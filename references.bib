	abstract = {Improving our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fine roots in deep soil layers is of utter importance to manage tropical planted forests in a context of climate change. Our study aimed to assess the effect of clear-cutting and drought on fine-root dynamics down to the water table in Brazilian ferralsol under eucalypt plantations conducted in coppice. Fine roots (i.e. diameter {\textless}2 mm) were sampled down to 17 m deep in a throughfall exclusion experiment comparing stands with 37\% of throughfall excluded by plastic sheets (−W) and stands without rain exclusion (+W). Root dynamics were studied using minirhizotron in two permanent pits down to 17 m deep, over 1 year before clear-cutting, then over 2 years in coppice, as well as down to 4 m deep in a non-harvested plot (NH) serving as a control. After harvesting, a spectacular fine root growth of trees conducted in coppice occurred in very deep soil layers ({\textgreater}13 m) and, surprisingly, root mortality remained extremely low whatever the depth and the treatment. Total fine-root biomass in coppice down to 17 m depth was 1266 and 1017 g m−2 in +W and −W, respectively, at 1.5 year after the clear-cut and was 1078 g m−2 in NH 7.5 years after planting. Specific root length and specific root area were about 15\% higher in −W than in +W. Proliferation of fine roots at great depths could be an adaptive mechanism for tree survival, enhancing the access to water stored in the subsoil. The root system established before clear-cutting provides access to water stored in very deep layers that probably contribute to mitigate the risk of tree mortality during prolonged drought periods when the eucalypt plantations is conducted in coppice after the clear-cut.},

	abstract = {Moniliophthora Pod Rot (MPR) caused by the fungus Moniliophthora roreri (Cif.) Evans et al., is one of the main limiting factors of cocoa production in Latin America. Currently insufficient information on the biology and epidemiology of the pathogen limits the development of efficient management options to control MPR. This research aims to elucidate MPR development through the following daily microclimatic variables: minimum and maximum temperatures, wetness frequency, average temperature and relative humidity in the highly susceptible cacao clone Pound-7 (incidence = 86\% 2008–2013 average). A total of 55 cohorts totaling 2,268 pods of 3–10 cm length, one to two months of age, were tagged weekly. Pods were assessed throughout their lifetime, every one or two weeks, and classified in 3 different categories: healthy, diseased with no sporulation, diseased with sporulating lesions. As a first step, we used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to determine with no a priori the period (when and for how long) each climatic variable was better related with the appearance of symptoms and sporulation. Then the significance of the candidate variables was tested in a complete GLMM. Daily average wetness frequency from day 14 to day 1, before tagging, and daily average maximum temperature from day 4 to day 21, after tagging, were the most explanatory variables of the symptoms appearance. The former was positively linked with the symptoms appearance when the latter exhibited a maximum at 30°C. The most important variables influencing sporulation were daily average minimum temperature from day 35 to day 58 and daily average maximum temperature from day 37 to day 48, both after tagging. Minimum temperature was negatively linked with the sporulation while maximum temperature was positively linked. Results indicated that the fungal microclimatic requirements vary from the early to the late cycle stages, possibly due to the pathogen’s long latent period. This information is valuable for development of new conceptual models for MPR and improvement of control methods.},

  abstract = {Despite the strong ecological importance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, their vertical distribution remains poorly understood. To our knowledge, ECM structures associated with trees have never been reported in~depths below~2 meters. In this study, fine roots and ECM root tips were sampled down to 4-m depth during the digging of two independent pits differing by their water availability. A meta-barcoding approach based on Illumina sequencing of internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) was carried out on DNA extracted from root samples (fine roots and ECM root tips separately). ECM fungi dominated the root-associated fungal community, with more than 90\% of sequences assigned to the genus Pisolithus. The morphological and barcoding results demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of ECM symbiosis down to 4-m. The molecular diversity of Pisolithus spp. was strongly dependent on depth, with soil pH and soil water content as primary drivers of the Pisolithus spp. structure. Altogether, our results highlight the importance to consider the ECM symbiosis in deep soil layers to improve our understanding of fine roots functioning in tropical soils.},

  abstract = {Tree growth is highly dependent on the absorptive function of fine roots for water and nutrients. Fine roots also play a major role in the global carbon (C) cycle, mainly through production, respiration, exudation and decomposition processes. Improving our understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of fine roots down to the root front is an important issue to identify more sustainable silvicultural practices for planted forests installed in areas with low soil fertility and prolonged drought periods. The Eucalyptus gender is the most planted in Brazil covering about 5.1 million hectares in 2012. Coppice management can be an advantage against water stress in eucalyptus plantations because the trees are likely to benefit of a root system exploring deep soil layers where the availability of water can be higher than in the topsoil. The objective of this study is to assess the production of fine roots, CO2, CH4 and N2O down to the water table after cutting the trees in Eucalyptus grandis plantation conducted in coppice, under two contrasting water supply regimes,. Two pits were excavated down to a depth of 17 m in a throughfall exclusion experiment: one in a plot with 37\% of throughfall excluded by plastic sheets, and one without rain exclusion. Another pit in an adjacent stand of the same age not harvested will make it possible to assess the effect of cutting the trees. Fine roots dynamics will be studied using the Minirhizotron technique: twenty four transparent polyvinyl chloride tubes were installed in the pits in 2014 (12 per pit) down to 17 m deep and 7 tubes down to 4 m deep in the stand not harvested. Images will be obtained by a circular scanner every 14 days over 1 year before cutting the trees and over 1.5 years in coppice after harvesting. The winrhizotron software will be used to estimate root growth in length and area. Gas sampling will be performed every two weeks for 24 months (6 months before and 1.5 years after cutting the trees) throughout the soil profiles down to the groundwater. Gas samples will be analysed by gas chromatography and a modelling approach will be used to estimate CO2, CH4 and N2O production rates. Dynamics of gas concentrations can provide additional insights into the heterogeneous gas exchange processes through soil depth and how the control of the fluxes at the soil surface are correlated to root dynamics in the whole soil profile. Improving our understanding of the factors controlling the fluxes of greenhouse gases throughout very deep soil profiles is needed to develop reliable process-based models likely to predict wood production at a large scale in forest companies.},

	abstract = {While the number of studies dealing with fine root dynamics in deep soils layers (depth {\textgreater} 1 m) has increased sharply recently, the phenology, the morphology, the anatomy and the role of deep fine roots are still poorly known in forest ecosystems. This review summarizes the current knowledge on fine root production, mortality and longevity in deep soil layers, mycorrhizal association with deep roots, and the role of deep fine roots on carbon, water and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Plant species are known to be more deeply rooted in tropical ecosystems than in temperate and boreal ecosystems, but deep-rooted species are common in a wide range of climates. Deep fine roots are highly plastic in response to changes in environmental conditions and soil resources. Recent studies show that functional traits can be different for deep and shallow roots, with a possible functional specialization of deep fine roots to take up nutrients. With higher vessel diameter and larger tracheid, the anatomy of deep fine roots is also oriented toward water acquisition and transport by increasing the hydraulic conductivity. Deep fine roots can have a great impact on the biogeochemical cycles in many forests (in particular in tropical areas where highly weathered soils are commonly very deep), making it possible to take up water and nutrients over dry periods and contributing to store carbon in the soil. The biogeochemical models in forest ecosystems need to consider the specificity of deep root functioning to better predict carbon, water and nutrient cycling as well as net ecosystem productivity.},
