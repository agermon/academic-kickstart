Results of the meta-analysis of FACE effects 18 Summary: Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments allow study of the effects of elevated [CO2] on plants and ecosystems grown under natural conditions without enclosure. Data from 120 primary, peer-reviewed articles describing physiology and production in the 12 large-scale FACE experiments (475–600 ppm) were collected and summarized using meta-analytic techniques. The results confirm some results from previous chamber experiments: light-saturated carbon uptake, diurnal C assimilation, growth and above-ground production increased, while specific leaf area and stomatal conductance decreased in elevated [CO2]. There were differences in FACE. Trees were more responsive than herbaceous species to elevated [CO2]. Grain crop yields increased far less than anticipated from prior enclosure studies. The broad direction of change in photosynthesis and production in elevated [CO2] may be similar in FACE and enclosure studies, but there are major quantitative differences: trees were more responsive than other functional types; C4 species showed little response; and the reduction in plant nitrogen was small and largely accounted for by decreased Rubisco. The results from this review may provide the most plausible estimates of how plants in their native environments and field-grown crops will respond to rising atmospheric [CO2]; but even with FACE there are limitations, which are also discussed.},

Scientists have now realized that many small farmers cope with and even prepare for climate change, minimizing crop failure through a series of agroecological practices. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to the high level of on-farm biodiversity, a typical feature of traditional farming systems.},

	title = {Agroforestry silvoarable systems with pollarded walnut trees : first evaluation by modeling and field monitoring},
	abstract = {In agroforestry systems (AFS) with annual intercrops, the competition for light, water and nitrogen plays a key role. Mature trees capture a larger part of the resources, and the yield of the intercrop decreases. When the tree stem density is high ({\textgreater}50 stems.ha -1), the yield of the intercrop may therefore drop to unprofitable levels. A possible solution to that competition problem would be to reduce the size of the trees by pollarding. Pollarded trees produce both timber with the bole and biomass or fodder with the leaves and branches that are regularly pruned every 2 to 10 year. The reduction of the size of the crown would also be profitable to the intercrops, allowing a sustained and profitable yield even with old trees. The concept was evaluated both by modeling with the Hi-sAFe numerical model and by an experiment comparing standard walnut trees and pollarded walnut trees. Numerical runs of the model indicate that AFS with pollarded trees may reach very high levels of tree-crop complementary, achieving higher Land Equivalent Ratios than AFS with standard trees. However, the model predicts that the diameter growth of the trunk could be heavily reduced by the pollarding regime. These predictions should be confirmed by field experiment. We settled an experiment with walnut trees aged 16 years in spring 2013. During the first growing season after pollarding, the girth growth of the pollarded trees was surprisingly not reduced, as compared to standard unpollarded trees. Some hypotheses to explain this behaviour are discussed. If this result is confirmed during the next years, the model should be modified to incorporate this aspect, and the productivity of the AFS with pollarded trees could be even higher.},

	doi = {10.1093/treephys/tpu107},
	abstract = {As tropical forests respond to environmental change, autotrophic respiration may consume a greater proportion of carbon fixed in photosynthesis at the expense of growth, potentially turning the forests into a carbon source. Predicting such a response requires that we measure and place autotrophic respiration in a complete carbon budget, but extrapolating measurements of autotrophic respiration from chambers to ecosystem remains a challenge. High plant species diversity and complex canopy structure may cause respiration rates to vary and measurements that do not account for this complexity may introduce bias in extrapolation more detrimental than uncertainty. Using experimental plantations of four native tree species with two canopy layers, we examined whether species and canopy layers vary in foliar respiration and wood CO2 efflux and whether the variation relates to commonly used scalars of mass, nitrogen (N), photosynthetic capacity and wood size. Foliar respiration rate varied threefold between canopy layers, approximately 0.74 mumol m(-2) s(-1) in the overstory and approximately 0.25 mumol m(-2) s(-1) in the understory, but little among species. Leaf mass per area, N and photosynthetic capacity explained some of the variation, but height explained more. Chamber measurements of foliar respiration thus can be extrapolated to the canopy with rates and leaf area specific to each canopy layer or height class. If area-based rates are sampled across canopy layers, the area-based rate may be regressed against leaf mass per area to derive the slope (per mass rate) to extrapolate to the canopy using the total leaf mass. Wood CO2 efflux varied 1.0-1.6 mumol m(-2) s(-1) for overstory trees and 0.6-0.9 mumol m(-2) s(-1) for understory species. The variation in wood CO2 efflux rate was mostly related to wood size, and little to species, canopy layer or height. Mean wood CO2 efflux rate per surface area, derived by regressing CO2 efflux per mass against the ratio of surface area to mass, can be extrapolated to the stand using total wood surface area. The temperature response of foliar respiration was similar for three of the four species, and wood CO2 efflux was similar between wet and dry seasons. For these species and this forest, vertical sampling may yield more accurate estimates than would temporal sampling.},

	abstract = {The Mesoamerican region is considered to be one of the areas in the world most vulnerable to climate change. We developed a framework for quantifying the vulnerability of the livelihoods of coffee growers in Mesoamerica at regional and local levels and identify adaptation strategies. Following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concepts, vulnerability was defined as the combination of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. To quantify exposure, changes in the climatic suitability for coffee and other crops were predicted through niche modelling based on historical climate data and locations of coffee growing areas from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Future climate projections were generated from 19 Global Circulation Models. Focus groups were used to identify nine indicators of sensitivity and eleven indicators of adaptive capacity, which were evaluated through semi-structured interviews with 558 coffee producers. Exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity were then condensed into an index of vulnerability, and adaptation strategies were identified in participatory workshops. Models predict that all target countries will experience a decrease in climatic suitability for growing Arabica coffee, with highest suitability loss for El Salvador and lowest loss for Mexico. High vulnerability resulted from loss in climatic suitability for coffee production and high sensitivity through variability of yields and out-migration of the work force. This was combined with low adaptation capacity as evidenced by poor post harvest infrastructure and in some cases poor access to credit and low levels of social organization. Nevertheless, the specific contributors to vulnerability varied strongly among countries, municipalities and families making general trends difficult to identify. Flexible strategies for adaption are therefore needed. Families need the support of government and institutions specialized in impacts of climate change and strengthening of farmer organizations to enable the adjustment of adaptation strategies to local needs and conditions.},

The accuracy of the theory is tested by comparing computations of mass and energy flux densities (water vapor, sensible heat, CO2 and ozone) against eddy covariance measurements over five distinct canopies (wheat, potato and soybean crops and a temperate broad-leaved and a boreal conifer forest). Once tested, the theory is used to evaluate how interactions between climate and vegetation might influence leaf area and photosynthetic capacity and, in turn, alter energy balance partitioning and the transfer rates of CO2 and other trace gases over vegetation canopies. Model parameters, derived from biogeochemical and eco-physiological principles, enabled the model to estimate rates of mass and energy exchange with reasonable fidelity. In particular, the theory reproduced the magnitudes and distinct diurnal patterns associated with mass and energy fluxes over a spectrum of vegetation types. Model sensitivity tests revealed that variations in leaf area index and photosynthetic capacity interacted to increase rates of evaporation and carbon dioxide and pollutant uptake, greatly, and in a curvilinear manner. Finally, we conclude that the assignment of many model parameters according to plant functional type has much potential for use in global and regional scale ecosystem, climate and biogeochemistry models.},

	abstract = {Fluxes of carbon dioxide, water and energy between a temperate deciduous forest and the atmosphere were quantified across time scales of hours, days, seasons, years and decades. This exercise was performed using stand-level eddy covariance flux measurements and a biophysical model, CANOAK. The CANOAK model was tested with measurements of carbon dioxide, water vapor and energy flux densities we have been collecting since October 1994. Model calculations reproduced 80\% of CO2 and water vapor flux variance that are contained in a year-long time series, when the model was forced with hourly weather data and seasonal information on plant structure and physiological capacity. Spectral analysis of measured and computed time series revealed that peak time scales of flux variance have periods of a day, half-week, season and year. We examined questions relating to inter-annual variability of mass and energy exchange by forcing the validated model with a decade-long meteorological record. Theoretical estimates of year-to-year variability of net ecosystem CO2 exchange were on the order of ±200 gC m−2 year. We also deduced that significant variance of water vapor and CO2 exchange occurs on the time scale of 5–6 years, the time scale associated with El Nino phenomena. Sensitivity tests performed with the model examined issues associated with model complex and parameterization issues. Of particular importance were the effects of leaf clumping and length of the growing season on canopy photosynthesis and net ecosystem CO2 exchange. Ignoring the effects of leaf clumping caused an error as large as 50\% in the estimation of annual biosphere–atmosphere net carbon exchange. Each incremental day change in the length of the growing season altered the net ecosystem CO2 exchange by 5.9 gC m−2.},

	abstract = {African oil palm has the highest productivity amongst cultivated oleaginous crops. Species can constitute a single crop capable to fulfil the growing global demand for vegetable oils, which is estimated to reach 240 million tons by 2050. Two types of vegetable oil are extracted from the palm fruit on commercial scale. The crude palm oil and kernel palm oil have different fatty acid profiles, which increases versatility of the crop in industrial applications. Plantations of the current varieties have economic life-span around 25-30 years and produce fruits around the year. Thus, predictable annual palm oil supply enables marketing plans and adjustments in line with the economic forecasts. Oil palm cultivation is one of the most profitable land uses in the humid tropics. Oil palm fruits are the richest plant source of pro-vitamin A and vitamin E. Hence, crop both alleviates poverty, and could provide a simple practical solution to eliminate global pro-vitamin A deficiency. Oil palm is a perennial, evergreen tree adapted to cultivation in biodiversity rich equatorial land areas. The growing demand for the palm oil threatens the future of the rain forests and has a large negative impact on biodiversity. Plant science faces three major challenges to make oil palm the key element of building the future sustainable world. The global average yield of 3.5 tons of oil per hectare (t) should be raised to the full yield potential estimated at 11-18t. The tree architecture must be changed to lower labor intensity and improve mechanization of the harvest. Oil composition should be tailored to the evolving needs of the food, oleochemical and fuel industries. The release of the oil palm reference genome sequence in 2013 was the key step towards this goal. The molecular bases of agronomically important traits can be and are beginning to be understood at the single base pair resolution, enabling gene-centered breeding and engineering of this remarkable crop.},

	abstract = {The area of mixed forest stands in western Europe has significantly increased during recent decades and is still increasing today. Tools are needed to support the forest management decision taking in these mixed forests. However, though pure stands have been modelled extensively and rather successfully for decades, relatively few models for mixed-species stands have been developed. In this study, a mechanistic tree-based model of mixed forest growth is presented and applied. The aims of the study were (1) to present the modelling concept, (2) to compare growth and yield of mixed stands and monospecies stands, and (3) to demonstrate potential model application by simulating effects of management on mixed Douglas-fir/beech stands. The effects of stand composition and management on mixed stand productivity were investigated by simulating a replacement series. Simulation results showed that in general the yield of the mixture was somewhere in between the yield levels of the two monocultures. In stands with a low proportion of basal area of Douglas-fir, the productivity of Douglas-fir was lower than could be expected from its basal area share in the mixture; in stands with more than 40\% of Douglas-fir, the opposite was the case. The productivity of beech in stands with few Douglas-fir was generally higher than expected from its proportion of basal area in the mixture, but much lower in mixtures with a higher Douglas-fir proportion. Thinning had a strong impact on productivity of the mixed stands. Yield of the mixtures was not linearly related to the basal area fraction of Douglas-fir present at the start of the simulations; simply combining monospecific yield tables will thus result in biased estimates of the yield of a mixed stand.},

	abstract = {Models seldom consider the effect of leaf-level biochemical acclimation to temperature when scaling forest water use. Therefore, the dependence of transpiration on temperature acclimation was investigated at the within-crown scale in climatically contrasting genotypes of Acer rubrum L., cv. October Glory (OG) and Summer Red (SR). The effects of temperature acclimation on intracanopy gradients in transpiration over a range of realistic forest growth temperatures were also assessed by simulation. Physiological parameters were applied, with or without adjustment for temperature acclimation, to account for transpiration responses to growth temperature. Both types of parameterization were scaled up to stand transpiration (expressed per unit leaf area) with an individual tree model (MAESTRA) to assess how transpiration might be affected by spatial and temporal distributions of foliage properties. The MAESTRA model performed well, but its reproducibility was dependent on physiological parameters acclimated to daytime temperature. Concordance correlation coefficients between measured and predicted transpiration were higher (0.95 and 0.98 versus 0.87 and 0.96) when model parameters reflected acclimated growth temperature. In response to temperature increases, the southern genotype (SR) transpiration responded more than the northern (OG). Conditions of elevated long-term temperature acclimation further separate their transpiration differences. Results demonstrate the importance of accounting for leaf-level physiological adjustments that are sensitive to microclimate changes and the use of provenance-, ecotype-, and/or genotype-specific parameter sets, two components likely to improve the accuracy of site-level and ecosystem-level estimates of transpiration flux.},

	abstract = {The ‘parklands’ that form the most widespread farming systems in the Sahelian zone of West Africa are farming systems in which annual crops are grown under scattered trees preserved from the natural vegetation by farmers following clearing the woodlands to make crop fields. Being mixed agricultural systems, the interactions between trees and crops have always been a key element determining the management options applied by farmers. This has also attracted the attention of scientists, with the first studies of this nature dating back to the 1960’s. A combination of field trials, observational studies and modeling has been deployed to understand soil–tree–crop interactions, including sharing of growth resources by the system components. Based on this understanding, management options have been discussed with farmers. The most common experimental designs used are transects from the base of tree trunk toward the open field, concentric zones around trees or sectors under trees where various experimental treatments are applied, depending on the objectives of the studies. Key findings disentangled the contributions of each component of the system to the island of high fertility around trees using isotopic techniques, tree effects on adjacent C4 cultivated plants and alternative C3 crops that tolerate tree shade. Tree management practices such as pruning have been tested to modify the crown architecture and the patterns of root distribution in order to improve light availability and resource use efficiency. Increases in land use intensity require more active management by farmers of tree regeneration. Despite scientific advances, there are still some methodological challenges in determining the “park effect”, the tradeoffs and synergies between and among goods and services, and how to boost the provisioning, supporting and regulating functions of such agroforestry systems. Providing such ecosystem service functions is critical in the quest for ensuring food security while achieving adaptation and mitigation goals in vulnerable environments like the drylands.},

	abstract = {Midday stomatal closure is mediated by the availability of water in the soil, leaf and atmosphere, but the response to these environmental and internal variables is highly species specific. We tested the hypothesis that species differences in stomatal response to humidity and soil water availability can be explained by two parameters: leaf-specific hydraulic conductance (K(L)) and a threshold leaf water potential (Psi(threshold)). We used a combination of original and published data to estimate characteristic values of K(L) and Psi(threshold) for four common tree species that have distinctly different stomatal behaviors: black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa Torr. \&amp; Gray.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.). We used the values to parameterize a simple, nonelastic model that predicts stomatal conductance by linking hydraulic flux to transpirational flux and maintaining Psi(leaf) above Psi(threshold). The model successfully predicted fundamental features of stomatal behavior that have been reported in the literature for these species. We conclude that much of the variation among the species in stomatal response to soil and atmospheric water deficits can be explained by K(L) and Psi(threshold). The relationship between Psi(threshold) and xylem vulnerability to cavitation differed among these species.},

	title = {Carbon storage and soil organic matter dynamics under mediterranean and temperate agroforestry systems},
	abstract = {Agroforestry is a land use type where trees are associated with crops and/or animals within the same field. This agroecosystem could help mitigating climate change, and also contribute to its adaptation. The goal of this thesis was to evaluate the potential of soil organic carbon storage under agroforestry systems. This study was performped at the oldest experimental site in France, a trial supervised by INRA since 1995, but also at farmers' fields. Soil organic carbon stocks were compared between agroforestry and agricultural plots, down to 2 m soil depth. All organic inputs to the soil were quantified (tree roots, leaf litter, crop roots and residues). The stability of additionnal stored carbon was caracterised with soil organic matter fractionation, and soil incubations. A model of soil organic carbon dynamic was described in order to better undrestand this dynamic in agroforestry, especially in deep soil layers. This study revealed the interest and the potential of agroforestry systems in increasing soil organic carbon stocks, with accumulation rates of 0.09 to 0.46 t C ha -1 yr -1. It also reveals the role of tree rows in this storage, and the importance of carbon inputs from root mortality. However, it raises concerns about the stability of this storage.
Les systèmes agroforestiers stockent du carbone dans la biomasse des arbres. Cependant leur intérêt ne se limite pas à ce carbone stocké sous forme de bois. En effet, les arbres produisent de grandes quantités de litières, et apportent également du carbone dans les horizons profonds du sol par la mortalité et l’exsudation racinaire. Or, les sols agricoles, ayant de très faibles teneurs en matière organique, ont un potentiel de stockage en carbone bien plus important que les sols forestiers. A ce jour, il n’existe pratiquement pas de travaux permettant d’avoir une estimation de l’impact des arbres agroforestiers sur le carbone du sol. La plupart des études sont en effet menées sur le stockage de carbone dans la biomasse aérienne des arbres. Une étude a ainsi estimé qu’en climat tempéré et pour des densités comprises entre 50 et 100 arbres/ha, le stockage de carbone serait compris entre 1.5 et 4 tC/ha/an, ce qui est très important comparé au potentiel de stockage d’autres systèmes de culture. On se propose donc dans ce travail de contribuer significativement à la connaissance sur les possibilités de stockage de C dans les sols en agroforesterie. Tout d’abord, nous quantifierons les stocks de C dans les parcelles agroforestières et les comparerons aux témoins agricoles. Nous étudierons également l’hétérogénéité spatiale de ces stocks, sous la ligne d’arbres ou sous la culture intercalaire, et ce à différentes profondeurs. Dans un deuxième temps, nous étudierons les entrées de carbone au sol, notamment via la mortalité racinaire des arbres. Puis, nous étudierons les processus liés à la stabilisation de ce carbone dans les horizons profonds du sol. Enfin, nous chercherons à savoir si l’apport de carbone frais dans les horizons du sol ne pourrait pas entraîner une minéralisation d’une partie du carbone stable du sol, phénomène connu sous le nom du priming effect, et qui pourrait jouer un rôle non négligeable dans le bilan de carbone de ces systèmes. La modélisation sera utilisée afin d’estimer le stockage de carbone sur le long terme. L’étude sera menée dans un contexte de système de culture méditerranéen, sur un site expérimental d’exception. L’analyse mécaniste fournira le cadre conceptuel pour la compréhension de la dynamique du C dans d’autres systèmes agroforestiers à l’avenir.},

	abstract = {In this study, the combined effects of light and water availability on the functional relationships of the relative growth rate (RGR), leaf chemical composition, construction and maintenance costs, and benefits in terms of payback time for Coffea arabica are presented. Coffee plants were grown for 8 months in 100\% or 15\% full sunlight and then a four-month water shortage was implemented. Plants grown under full sunlight were also transferred to shade and vice versa. Overall, most of the traits assessed were much more responsive to the availability of light than to the water supply. Larger construction costs (12\%), primarily associated with elevated phenol and alkaloid pools, were found under full sunlight. There was a positive correlation between these compounds and the RGR, the mass-based net carbon assimilation rate and the carbon isotope composition ratio, which, in turn, correlated negatively with the specific leaf area. The payback time was remarkably lower in the sun than in shade leaves and increased greatly in water-deprived plants. The differences in maintenance costs among the treatments were narrow, with no significant impact on the RGR, and there was no apparent trade-off in resource allocation between growth and defence. The current irradiance during leaf bud formation affected both the specific leaf area and leaf physiology upon transferring the plants from low to high light and vice versa. In summary, sun-grown plants fixed more carbon for growth and secondary metabolism, with the net effect of an increased RGR.},

	abstract = {Historically, early stress-induced changes in plants have been mainly detected after destructive sampling followed by biochemical and molecular determinations. Imaging techniques that allow immediate detection of stress-situations, before visual symptoms appear and adverse effects become established, are emerging as promising tools for crop yield management. Such monitoring approaches can also be applied to screen plant populations for mutants with increased stress tolerance. At the laboratory scale, different imaging methods can be tested and one or a combination best suited for crop surveillance chosen. The system of choice can be applied under controlled laboratory conditions to guide selective sampling for the molecular characterisation of rapid stress-induced changes. Such an approach permits to isolate presymptomatically induced genes, or to obtain a panoramic view of early gene expression using gene-arrays when plants undergo physiological changes undetected by the human eye. Using this knowledge, plants can be engineered to be more stress resistant, and tested for field performance by the same methodologies. In ongoing efforts of genome characterisation, genes of unknown function are revealed at an ever-accelerating pace. By monitoring changes in phenotypic characteristics of transgenic plants expressing those genes, imaging techniques could help to identify their function.},

However, a major paradigm is that the reduction in absorbed photosynthetically active radiation is, to a certain extent, compensated by an increase in light-use efficiency, thereby reducing the difference in net primary productivity between shaded and non-shaded plants. Due to the large spatial heterogeneity in agroforestry systems and the lack of appropriate tools, the combined effects of such variables have seldom been analysed, even though they may help understand physiological processes underlying yield dynamics. In this study, we monitored net primary productivity, during two years, on scales ranging from individual coffee plants to the entire plot. Absorbed radiation was mapped with a 3D model (MAESPA). Light-use efficiency and net assimilation rate were derived for each coffee plant individually. We found that although irradiance was reduced by 60\% below crowns of shade trees, coffee light-use efficiency increased by 50\%, leaving net primary productivity fairly stable across all shade levels. Variability of aboveground net primary productivity of coffee plants was caused primarily by the age of the plants and by intraspecific competition among them (drivers usually overlooked in the agroforestry literature) rather than by the presence of shade trees.},

	title = {The contribution of agroforestry systems to climate change mitigation – {Assessment} of {C} storage in soils in a {Mediterranean} context. [{P}-2218-01]},
	abstract = {Agroforestry is a land use type where crops and trees are grown together in the same place and at the same time. Agroforestry systems have the advantage of providing multiple products (e.g. wood, fruits) or services (e.g. biodiversity enhancement, erosion control) whilst maintaining agricultural production. If they are known to store carbon into the biomass of the trees, they could also increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. However their impact has rarely been studied under temperate or Mediterranean conditions and has mostly concerned superficial soil layers. Our objectives were (i) to quantify and spatialize SOC stocks in an agroforestry system and in an adjacent agricultural plot, (ii) to assess what SOC fractions are responsible for possible additional carbon storage, and (iii) to quantify all organic inputs entering the soil. The trial was established in 1995 in southern France. Hybrid walnut trees are intercropped with durum wheat. SOC stocks were measured on 200 soil cores down to 2 m soil depth, and particle-size fractionation was performed on 64 soil samples. Carbon stocks of trees and of the herbaceous vegetation in the tree rows were also quantified. A trench was dug to 4 m soil depth to quantify tree fine root distribution and biomass. Minirhizotrons were installed at different depths to study tree fine root turnover. Annual additional SOC storage rates were estimated at 259 ± 59 kg C ha-1 yr-1 (0-30 cm) and at 350 ± 88 kg C ha-1 yr-1 (0-100 cm). Additional storage was mainly due to particulate organic matter fractions ({\textgreater} 50 μm) and 10 to 15\% was associated to clay particles. When the aboveground biomass of the trees was taken into account, total organic carbon storage rate reached 1.11 ± 0.16 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. High tree root densities were observed at depth, but root turnover decreased with depth. Agroforestry systems provide higher amounts of carbon at depth than other agricultural practices, such as no-till farming, and could therefore provide a more stable C storage in the long-term.

Although large amounts of potassium (K) are applied in tropical crops and planted forests, little is known about the interaction between K nutrition and water deficit on the physiological mechanisms governing plant growth. A process-based model (MAESPA) parameterized in a split-plot experiment in Brazil was used to gain insight into the combined effects of K deficiency and water deficit on absorbed radiation (aPAR), gross primary productivity (GPP), and light-use efficiency for carbon assimilation and stem biomass production (LUEC and LUEs ) in Eucalyptus grandis plantations. The main-plot factor was the water supply (undisturbed rainfall vs. 37\% of throughfall excluded) and the subplot factor was the K supply (with or without 0.45 mol K m(-2 ) K addition). Mean GPP was 28\% lower without K addition over the first 3 years after planting whether throughfall was partly excluded or not. K deficiency reduced aPAR by 20\% and LUEC by 10\% over the whole period of growth. With K addition, throughfall exclusion decreased GPP by 25\%, resulting from a 21\% decrease in LUEC at the end of the study period. The effect of the combination of K deficiency and water deficit was less severe than the sum of the effects of K deficiency and water deficit individually, leading to a reduction in stem biomass production, gross primary productivity and LUE similar to K deficiency on its own. The modeling approach showed that K nutrition and water deficit influenced absorbed radiation essentially through changes in leaf area index and tree height. The changes in gross primary productivity and light-use efficiency were, however, driven by a more complex set of tree parameters, especially those controlling water uptake by roots and leaf photosynthetic capacities.},

Evidence suggests that this will not be achieved by wide scale promotion of a few iconic agroforestry practices. Instead, three key issues need to be addressed. First, fine-scale variation in social, economic and ecological context and how this creates a need for local adaptation. Second, the importance of developing appropriate service delivery mechanisms, markets, and institutional contexts, as well as technologies. Third, appropriate research design, within the scaling process, that enables co-learning amongst research, development and private sector actors. This requires a new paradigm that builds on previous integrated systems approaches, but goes further, by embedding research centrally within development praxis.},

Waring et al. (1998) suggested that a NPP:GPP ratio of 0.47 +/- 0.04 (s.d.) is universal across biomes, tree species and stand ages. Representing NPP in models as a fixed fraction of GPP, they argued, would be both simpler and more accurate than trying to simulate Ra mechanistically. This paper reviews progress in understanding the NPP:GPP ratio in forests during the 20 years since Waring et al.. Research has confirmed the existence of pervasive acclimation mechanisms that tend to stabilize the NPP:GPP ratio, and indicates that Ra should not be modelled independently of GPP. Nonetheless, studies indicate that the value of this ratio is influenced by environmental factors, stand age and management. The average NPP:GPP ratio in over 200 studies, representing different biomes, species and forest stand ages, was found to be 0.46, consistent with the central value that Waring et al. proposed but with a much larger standard deviation (+/- 0.12) and a total range (0.22 to 0.79) that is too large to be disregarded.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a system of models for the simulation of gas and energy exchange of a leaf of a C3 plant in free air. The physiological processes are simulated by sub-models that: (a) give net photosynthesis (An) as a function of environmental and leaf parameters and stomatal conductance (gs); (b) give g, as a function of the concentration of CO2 and H2O in air at the leaf surface and the current rate of photosynthesis of the leaf. An energy balance and mass transport sub-model is used to couple the physiological processes through a variable boundary layer to the ambient environment. The models are based on theoretical and empirical analysis of gs, and An measured at the leaf level, and tests with intact attached leaves of soybeans show very good agreement between predicted and measured responses of gs and An over a wide range of leaf temperatures (20–35°C), CO2 concentrations (10–90 Pa), air to leaf water vapor deficits (0.5–3.7 kPa) and light intensities (100–2000 μmol m−2s−1). The combined models were used to simulate the responses of latent heat flux (λE) and gs for a soybean canopy for the course of an idealized summer day, using the ‘big-leaf’ approximation. Appropriate data are not yet available to provide a rigorous test of these simulations, but the response patterns are similar to field observations. These simulations show a pronounced midday depression of λE and gs at low or high values of boundary-layer conductance. Deterioration of plant water relations during midday has often been invoked to explain this common natural phenomenon, but the present models do not consider this possibility. Analysis of the model indicates that the simulated midday depression is, in part, the result of positive feedback mediated by the boundary layer. For example, a change in gs affects An and λE. As a consequence, the temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration of the air in the proximity of the stomata (e.g. the air at the leaf surface) change and these, in turn, affect gs. The simulations illustrate the possible significance of the boundary layer in mediating feedback loops which affect the regulation of stomatal conductance and λE. The simulations also examine the significance of changing the response properties of the photosynthetic component of the model by changing leaf protein content or the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere.},

This provides the plant with a stomatal response mechanism in which water potential is perceived in the root as an indication of soil water status and available water resources. There is also ample evidence that stomata respond directly to some component of leaf water status. This provides additional information about water potential gradients developing between root and shoot as the result of water transport, allowing for a more stable regulation of shoot water status and better protection of the transport system itself. The precise location at which leaf water status is sensed, however, and the molecular events transducing this signal into a guard cell response are not yet known. Major questions therefore remain unanswered on how water stress signals perceived at root and leaf locations are integrated at the guard cell to control stomatal behaviour.},

Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.61 trillion in temperate regions. Biome-level trends in tree density demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming effect of humans across most of the world.

The treatment of this control has been required by land components of climate and carbon models. Physiological models can be used to simulate the responses of stomatal conductance to changes in atmospheric and soil environments. Big-leaf models that treat a canopy as a single leaf tend to overestimate fluxes of CO2 and water vapor. Models that differentiate between sunlit and shaded leaves largely overcome these problems. A one-layered, two-big-leaf submodel for photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, leaf temperature, and energy fluxes is presented in this paper. It includes 1) an improved two stream approximation model of radiation transfer of the canopy, with attention to singularities in its solution and with separate integrations of radiation absorption by sunlit and shaded fractions of canopy; 2) a photosynthesis?stomatal conductance model for sunlit and shaded leaves separately, and for the simultaneous transfers of CO2 and water vapor into and out of the leaf?leaf physiological properties (i.e., leaf nitrogen concentration, maximum potential electron transport rate, and hence photosynthetic capacity) vary throughout the plant canopy in response to the radiation?weight time-mean profile of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and the soil water limitation is applied to both maximum rates of leaf carbon uptake by Rubisco and electron transport, and the model scales up from leaf to canopy separately for all sunlit and shaded leaves; 3) a well-built quasi-Newton?Raphson method for simultaneous solution of temperatures of the sunlit and shaded leaves. The model was incorporated into the Common Land Model (CLM) and is denoted CLM 2L. It was driven with observational atmospheric forcing from two forest sites [Anglo-Brazilian Amazonian Climate Observation Study (ABRACOS) and Boreal Ecosystem?Atmosphere Study (BOREAS)] for 2 yr of simulation. The simulated fluxes by CLM 2L were compared with the observations, and with the results by the CLM with a single big-leaf scheme (CLM 1L) and by the CLM with the assimilation?stomatal conductance scheme of NCAR Land Surface Model (LSM). The results showed that CLM 2L was an improvement compared to the CLM 1L and the CLM for the test cases of tropical evergreen broadleaf land cover and coniferous boreal forest.

The results showed that CLM 2L was an improvement compared to the CLM 1L and the CLM for the test cases of tropical evergreen broadleaf land cover and coniferous boreal forest.},

To investigate the mechanisms underlying this response, two commercial coffee cultivars (Catuaí and Obatã) were grown using the first free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) facility in Latin America. Measurements were conducted in two contrasting growth seasons, which were characterized by the high (February) and low (August) sink demand. Elevated [CO2] led to increases in net photosynthetic rates (A) in parallel with decreased photorespiration rates, with no photochemical limitations to A. The stimulation of A by elevated CO2 supply was more prominent in August (56\% on average) than in February (40\% on average). Overall, the stomatal and mesophyll conductances, as well as the leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, were unresponsive to the treatments. Photosynthesis was strongly limited by diffusional constraints, particularly at the stomata level, and this pattern was little, if at all, affected by elevated [CO2]. Relative to February, starch pools (but not soluble sugars) increased remarkably (\&gt;500\%) in August, with no detectable alteration in the maximum carboxylation capacity estimated on a chloroplast [CO2] basis. Upregulation of A by elevated [CO2] took place with no signs of photosynthetic downregulation, even during the period of low sink demand, when acclimation would be expected to be greatest.},

	abstract = {Computer representations of plants (virtual plants) are used as the basis for a model simulating leaf transpiration and sap flow. The virtual plants provide a detailed description of plant geometry and topology and, once positioned in a scene, enable a highly realistic reconstruction of a portion of the canopy. Stomatal conductance as well as energy balance are simulated by the model at the level of individual leaves in order to calculate their transpiration. Leaf transpiration is then cumulated to get the sap flow throughout the plant. Owing to its structure, the model can take into account feedbacks such as the effect of the temperature of a leaf on its stomatal conductance, transpiration and water potential, and in return, the effect of water potential of a leaf on its stomatal conductance. The model has been validated on a coffee tree stand in Costa Rica. The geometry (i.e. 3D position, area and diameter of organs) of six adult coffee trees in a row was measured in the field in order to generate a computer scene. Stomatal conductance, sap flow, water potential and wood hydraulic conductivity were measured for model parameterisation and validation. Analysis of model outputs lead to a correction of leaf boundary layer thickness. After calibration, the model exhibited correct values of transpiration and water potential in different microclimatic conditions.},

	abstract = {The paper reviews how we can learn from the past about climate-human-interactions at the present time, and in the future. It focuses on data sources for environmental change at local and regional/global spatial scales, and shows the scope and limitations of each. The use of parallel histories in local case-studies is described in a case-study from China, where independent records help unravel the complexity of interactions and provide a basis for assessing the resilience and sustainability of the landscape system. Holocene global records for Natural Forcings (e.g. climate and tectonics), Human Society and Ecosystems are reviewed, and the problems of reconstructing global records of processes that are only recorded at local scales examined. Existing regional/global records are used to speculate about the veracity of anthropogenic forcing of global climate. The paper concludes that a full understanding of causes of earth system change through (at least) the Holocene can come only through the most rigorous reconstructions of climate, human activities and earth processes, and importantly their interactions, at all locations and at all scales. It follows that we need to promote inter-scale learning: regionalisation and generalisation of existing data would be useful first steps. There is now a need to develop long-term simulation models that can help anticipate complex ecosystem behaviour and environmental processes in the face of global environmental change ? and resolving our past is an essential element in that endeavour.},

The forest stand is described as consisting of trees of different size cohorts (for example, dominant, co-dominant and suppressed trees), either of the same or of different species (deciduous or coniferous). Half-hourly C and H2O fluxes are modeled at the leaf, tree and stand level. In addition to total growth and yield, the model simulates the daily evolution of tracheid or vessel biomass and radius, parenchyma and branch development. From these data early and latewood biomass, wood tissue composition and density are calculated. Simulation of the labile C stored in the living tissues allows for simulation of trans-seasonal and trans-yearly effects, and improved simulations of long-term effects of environmental stresses on growth. A sensitivity analysis was performed to indicate the main parameters influencing simulated stem growth and wood quality at the tree and stand level. Case studies were performed for a temperate pine forest to illustrate the main model functioning and, more in particular, the simulation of the wood quality. The results indicate that the ANAFORE model is a useful tool for simultaneous analyses of wood quality development and forest ecosystem functioning.},

	doi = {10.1093/aob/mcw153},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Costa Rica, coffee (Coffea arabica) plants are often grown in agroforests. However, it is not known if shade-inducing trees reduce coffee plant biomass through root competition, and hence alter overall net primary productivity (NPP). We estimated biomass and NPP at the stand level, taking into account deep roots and the position of plants with regard to trees. METHODS: Stem growth and root biomass, turnover and decomposition were measured in mixed coffee/tree (Erythrina poeppigiana) plantations. Growth ring width and number at the stem base were estimated along with stem basal area on a range of plant sizes. Root biomass and fine root density were measured in trenches to a depth of 4 m. To take into account the below-ground heterogeneity of the agroforestry system, fine root turnover was measured by sequential soil coring (to a depth of 30 cm) over 1 year and at different locations (in full sun or under trees and in rows/inter-rows). Allometric relationships were used to calculate NPP of perennial components, which was then scaled up to the stand level. KEY RESULTS: Annual ring width at the stem base increased up to 2.5 mm yr-1 with plant age (over a 44-year period). Nearly all (92 \%) coffee root biomass was located in the top 1.5 m, and only 8 \% from 1.5 m to a depth of 4 m. Perennial woody root biomass was 16 t ha-1 and NPP of perennial roots was 1.3 t ha-1 yr-1 Fine root biomass (0-30 cm) was two-fold higher in the row compared with between rows. Fine root biomass was 2.29 t ha-1 (12 \% of total root biomass) and NPP of fine roots was 2.96 t ha-1 yr-1 (69 \% of total root NPP). Fine root turnover was 1.3 yr-1 and lifespan was 0.8 years. CONCLUSIONS: Coffee root systems comprised 49 \% of the total plant biomass; such a high ratio is possibly a consequence of shoot pruning. There was no significant effect of trees on coffee fine root biomass, suggesting that coffee root systems are very competitive in the topsoil.},

	abstract = {Drought is a major environmental constraint affecting growth and production of coffee. The effects of water supply on growth, biomass allocation, water relations, and gas exchange in two coffee progenies representing drought-tolerant (Siriema) and drought-sensitive (Catucai) genotypes were compared. They were grown in 12-L pots until 4-months old, when they were submitted to two watering treatments for 60 d: plants receiving either 100\% transpired water (control plants) or a fraction (about 40\%) of the amount of water transpired by control plants (drought-stressed plants). Under control conditions, Siriema grew faster than Catucai. Regardless of the watering regimes and progenies, relative growth rate (RGR) was positively correlated both with net assimilation rate (NAR) and long-term water-use efficiency (WUE), but not with differences in biomass allocation. Both progenies responded to drought stress through (i) similar decreases in both RGR and NAR with marginal, if any, changes in allocation; (ii) decreases in leaf water potential, which occurred to a greater extent in Catucai than in Siriema, even though they have showed similar abilities to adjust osmotically and elastically; (iii) similar reductions in net photosynthesis due mainly to nonstomatal factors; and (iv) decreases in transpiration rate coupled with increased long-term WUE. However, the lower transpiration rate and the higher long-term WUE as found in Siriema relative to Catucai under control conditions persisted under drought conditions. Overall, the major differences between these progenies were largely associated with differences in plant water use, which was likely related to the improved water status of Siriema. The possible implications of selecting coffee genotypes for high WUE are discussed.},

	abstract = {South African forest plantations, by virtue of their presence in very limited areas of high rainfall, and their increased water use relative to preafforestation vegetation, have caused significant reductions in streamflow from afforested catchments. The demand for both water and wood products is expected to increase strongly in the future, challenging the forestry industry to increase efficiency, both in timber production and in minimising the impacts of forest plantations on water supplies. Climate change adds a degree of uncertainty to future scenarios. As GCM predictions improve and regional predictions of climate change become more certain, the consequences to forests and water supplies must be comprehended and anticipated. This paper reviews aspects of these relationships with potential significance for the minimisation of water use of plantations and for the prediction of climate change consequences.

	abstract = {Uneven patterns in the rate of climate change have profound implications for adaptation. Assuming a linear or monotonic increase in global or regional temperatures can lead to inefficient planning processes that underestimate the magnitude, pattern, and timing of the risks faced by human and natural systems, which could exaggerate future impacts and the costs of managing them. Adaptation planning needs to move beyond imposing linear thinking and analysis onto nonlinear systems. Doing so would improve research into adaptive management processes that learn from and adapt to new knowledge at a pace that reflects non-linearity. Specifically, the pace of adaptation must consider the potential consequences of uneven increases in weather and climate variables as a means to reduce system vulnerability. Projections simulating periods of relative stability with those of rapid change would lead to more complex and more accurate expectations of future risks and associated consequences for human and natural systems. Adaptation planning based on such projections could then consider the implications of non-linear climate change on the extent of any adaptation effort, including quantified (or qualitative) risks and associated costs and benefits. Adaptation planning could be improved by projections that incorporate more nuanced understandings of how development processes could interact with climate change to alter future risks and vulnerabilities. Two examples are highlighted to illustrate the complexity and dynamic nature of non-monotonic climate-development-response scenarios: vector borne diseases and agricultural productivity.},

	abstract = {Abstract Irrigated corn (Zea mays L.) is an important feed grain crop on the Southern High Plains where the supply of water for irrigation is declining. Limited irrigation-applying less water than is required to meet potential evapotranspiration-is extensively practiced on the drought tolerant crops of grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). The purpose of this paper is (i) to report the effects of timing and duration of water deficit periods on growth and yield components of corn, (ii) to evaluate the seasonal evapotranspiration requirements of corn, and (iii) to give further information regarding the adaptation of corn for limited irrigation in a region of normally high evaporative demand climate. In a 4-yr study, corn was grown under five irrigation treatments: adequate water, 2- and 4-week water deficit periods during vegetative growth, and 2- and 4-week water deficit periods during grain filling. Water deficits imposed 41 days after planting reduced leaf, stalk, and ear yields, while those imposed 55 days after planting reduced only stalk and ear yields. Deficits during vegetative growth reduced kernel numbers but had little effect on weight per kernel. Deficits during grain filling did not affect leaf and stalk yields but reduced ear yields. Kernel numbers were not affected by water deficits during grain filling unless severe deficits were imposed early in the period; thus, grain yield reductions were proportional to reductions in weight per kernel. With adequate water, seasonal water use averaged 964 mm on graded furrows and 834 mm in level borders. Although water use efficiency (WUE) was sometimes increased slightly when plants were subjected to water deficits, the data indicate that limited irrigation of corn would not be feasible on the Southern High Plains.},

	doi = {10.1111/gcb.13269},
	abstract = {Well-defined productivity–precipitation relationships of ecosystems are needed as benchmarks for the validation of land models used for future projections. The productivity–precipitation relationship may be studied in two ways: the spatial approach relates differences in productivity to those in precipitation among sites along a precipitation gradient (the spatial fit, with a steeper slope); the temporal approach relates interannual productivity changes to variation in precipitation within sites (the temporal fits, with flatter slopes). Precipitation–reduction experiments in natural ecosystems represent a complement to the fits, because they can reduce precipitation below the natural range and are thus well suited to study potential effects of climate drying. Here, we analyse the effects of dry treatments in eleven multiyear precipitation–manipulation experiments, focusing on changes in the temporal fit. We expected that structural changes in the dry treatments would occur in some experiments, thereby reducing the intercept of the temporal fit and displacing the productivity–precipitation relationship downward the spatial fit. The majority of experiments (72\%) showed that dry treatments did not alter the temporal fit. This implies that current temporal fits are to be preferred over the spatial fit to benchmark land-model projections of productivity under future climate within the precipitation ranges covered by the experiments. Moreover, in two experiments, the intercept of the temporal fit unexpectedly increased due to mechanisms that reduced either water loss or nutrient loss. The expected decrease of the intercept was observed in only one experiment, and only when distinguishing between the late and the early phases of the experiment. This implies that we currently do not know at which precipitation–reduction level or at which experimental duration structural changes will start to alter ecosystem productivity. Our study highlights the need for experiments with multiple, including more extreme, dry treatments, to identify the precipitation boundaries within which the current temporal fits remain valid.},

This special issue presents the latest developments in FSP modelling, including the novel incorporation of plant ecophysiological concepts and the application of FSP models to address new scientific questions. Additionally, it illustrates the breadth of model evaluation approaches that are performed. FSP modelling is a very active domain of plant research which brings together a wide range of scientific disciplines. It offers the opportunity to address questions in complex plant systems that cannot be addressed by empirical approaches alone, including questions on fundamental concepts related to plant development such as regulation of morphogenesis, as well as on applied concepts such as the relationship between crop performance and plant competition for resources.},

	abstract = {We review and qualitatively assess the importance of interactions and feedbacks in assessing climate change impacts on water and agriculture in Europe. We focus particularly on the impact of future hydrological changes on agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation and adaptation options. Future projected trends in European agriculture include northward movement of crop suitability zones and increasing crop productivity in Northern Europe, but declining productivity and suitability in Southern Europe. This may be accompanied by a widening of water resource differences between the North and South, and an increase in extreme rainfall events and droughts. Changes in future hydrology and water management practices will influence agricultural adaptation measures and alter the effectiveness of agricultural mitigation strategies. These interactions are often highly complex and influenced by a number of factors which are themselves influenced by climate. Mainly positive impacts may be anticipated for Northern Europe, where agricultural adaptation may be shaped by reduced vulnerability of production, increased water supply and reduced water demand. However, increasing flood hazards may present challenges for agriculture, and summer irrigation shortages may result from earlier spring runoff peaks in some regions. Conversely, the need for effective adaptation will be greatest in Southern Europe as a result of increased production vulnerability, reduced water supply and increased demands for irrigation. Increasing flood and drought risks will further contribute to the need for robust management practices. The impacts of future hydrological changes on agricultural mitigation in Europe will depend on the balance between changes in productivity and rates of decomposition and GHG emission, both of which depend on climatic, land and management factors. Small increases in European soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks per unit land area are anticipated considering changes in climate, management and land use, although an overall reduction in the total stock may result from a smaller agricultural land area. Adaptation in the water sector could potentially provide additional benefits to agricultural production such as reduced flood risk and increased drought resilience. The two main sources of uncertainty in climate impacts on European agriculture and water management are projections of future climate and their resulting impacts on water and agriculture. Since changes in climate, agricultural ecosystems and hydrometeorology depend on complex interactions between the atmosphere, biosphere and hydrological cycle there is a need for more integrated approaches to climate impacts assessments. Methods for assessing options which "moderate" the impact of agriculture in the wider sense will also need to consider cross-sectoral impacts and socio-economic aspects.},

Remote sensing could provide inexpensive, largearea estimates of N status and be used to monitor N status since leaf chlorophyll (Chi) A content is mainly determined by N availability. The objective was to determine if remote sensing of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Chi A content would provide a rapid estimation of wheat N status. We measured the reflectance of a wheat crop submitted to five different fertilization treatments throughout the growth cycle. We tested several empirical reflectance indices of pigment content: reflectance at 550 nm (R550), reflectance at 680 nm (R680), three parameters of the red edge [wavelength (λre), amplitude in the first derivative of the reflectance spectra (dRre), and sum of amplitudes between 680 and 780 nm in the first derivative of the reflectance spectra (ΣdR680–780nm)], and pigment simple ratio (PSR) and normalized pigment chlorophyll index (NPCI) (indices of carotenoid/Chl ratio). We also measured leaf Chi A and N content, and leaf area index. There were significant correlations between canopy Chi A content and R550, R680, and all the red edge parameters. The NPCI and PSR followed phenological evolution of the carotenoids/Chl A ratio and separated the different treatments. By discriminant analysis based on the pigment indices reflectance at 430 nm (R430), R550, R680, λre, dRre, and NPCI, each reflectance spectrum can be assigned to a different N status class. Thus, the use of these optical techniques offers a potential for assessing N status of wheat.},

Empirical and allometric methods are easily developed and computationally efficient, but lack the power of evolution-based approaches to explain and predict multifaceted effects of environmental variability and climate change. In evolution-based methods, allocation is usually determined by maximization of a fitness proxy, either in a fixed environment, which we call optimal response (OR) models, or including the feedback of an individual's strategy on its environment (game-theoretical optimization, GTO). Optimal response models can predict allocation in single trees and stands when there is significant competition only for one resource. Game-theoretical optimization can be used to account for additional dimensions of competition, e.g., when strong root competition boosts root allocation at the expense of wood production. However, we demonstrate that an OR model predicts similar allocation to a GTO model under the root-competitive conditions reported in free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiments. The most evolutionarily realistic approach is adaptive dynamics (AD) where the allocation strategy arises from eco-evolutionary dynamics of populations instead of a fitness proxy. We also discuss emerging entropy-based approaches that offer an alternative thermodynamic perspective on allocation, in which fitness proxies are replaced by entropy or entropy production. To help develop allocation models further, the value of wide-ranging datasets, such as FLUXNET, could be greatly enhanced by ancillary measurements of driving variables, such as water and soil nitrogen availability.},

We analyzed within-species variation in eight leaf traits in 60 Coffea arabica plants, across four management treatments differing in shade-tree species composition, to test (i) if hypothesized LES patterns also describe within-species trait variation, and (ii) if LES traits vary in response to management regimes, or are correlated with reproductive output. Leaf traits varied widely across coffee plants with photosynthetic rates (Amass) and leaf area showing especially high variation. In bivariate and multivariate analyses, coffee leaf traits covaried in patterns consistent with the LES, suggesting shifts between leaf-level resource acquisition and conservation traits among plants may also underpin coffee responses to agroforestry management. The position of a coffee plant along the LES (as described by a principal component analysis score) was best explained by light availability, but did not vary systematically with shade tree composition. LES traits were weakly but significantly related to plant-level reproductive output: coffee plants associated with lower Amass and leaf N values, and higher leaf mass per area were associated with greater reproductive output. In showing that the LES describes resource capture and/or conservation strategies among coffee plants, our study represents a novel adoption of the LES to address applied questions in managed systems. Since within species differences in leaf traits partially explain differences in coffee yield, we also suggest that trait-based research in agroecology can contribute to an applied and comprehensive understanding of crop functional biology, and ultimately, agroecosystem structure and function.},

	abstract = {Background and aims Grapevines growing in Australia are often exposed to very high temperatures and the question of how the gas exchange processes adjust to these conditions is not well understood. The aim was to develop a model of photosynthesis and transpiration in relation to temperature to quantify the impact of the growing conditions on vine performance.Methodology Leaf gas exchange was measured along the grapevine shoots in accordance with their growth and development over several growing seasons. Using a general linear statistical modelling approach, photosynthesis and transpiration were modelled against leaf temperature separated into bands and the model parameters and coefficients applied to independent datasets to validate the model.Principal results Photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance varied along the shoot, with early emerging leaves having the highest rates, but these declined as later emerging leaves increased their gas exchange capacities in accordance with development. The general linear modelling approach applied to these data revealed that photosynthesis at each temperature was additively dependent on stomatal conductance, internal CO2 concentration and photon flux density. The temperature-dependent coefficients for these parameters applied to other datasets gave a predicted rate of photosynthesis that was linearly related to the measured rates, with a 1 : 1 slope. Temperature-dependent transpiration was multiplicatively related to stomatal conductance and the leaf to air vapour pressure deficit and applying the coefficients also showed a highly linear relationship, with a 1 : 1 slope between measured and modelled rates, when applied to independent datasets.Conclusions The models developed for the grapevines were relatively simple but accounted for much of the seasonal variation in photosynthesis and transpiration. The goodness of fit in each case demonstrated that explicitly selecting leaf temperature as a model parameter, rather than including temperature intrinsically as is usually done in more complex models, was warranted.},

The availability of energy, soil water and nutrients is estimated from field data at the scale of crown and root system fractions, taking into account the individual neighbourhood. The model includes a simple estimation of radiation distribution and the simulation of carbon and nutrient exchange. Senescence is represented by compartment-specific turnover rates. Allocation of carbon and nitrogen into foliage, fine roots, branches, coarse roots, and the stem is calculated according to functional balance and pipe model principles. Dimensional changes are calculated annually according to the distribution of net assimilation. The model describes tree development as a response to individual environmental conditions and changes environmental conditions with individual tree development. Due to this feedback loop, environmental influences can be assessed in any kind of species mixture or stand structure. Furthermore, the physiological-based approach ensures that the model can be used for investigations of complex environmental changes, e.g. CO2 concentration, precipitation, temperature and nitrogen deposition. Thus, it is particularly suitable to analyse field investigations and to support the cognition process on the ecology of forests.

Forest landscape models (FLM) are used by managers and policy-makers to make projections of future ecosystem dynamics under alternative management or policy options, but the links between the fundamental drivers and projected responses are weak and indirect, limiting their reliability for projecting the impacts of climate change. We developed and tested a relatively mechanistic method to simulate the effects of changing precipitation on species competition within the LANDIS-II FLM. Using data from a field precipitation manipulation experiment in a pinon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) ecosystem in New Mexico (USA), we calibrated our model to measurements from ambient control plots and tested predictions under the drought and irrigation treatments against empirical measurements. The model successfully predicted behavior of physiological variables under the treatments. Discrepancies between model output and empirical data occurred when the monthly time step of the model failed to capture the short-term dynamics of the ecosystem as recorded by instantaneous field measurements. We applied the model to heuristically assess the effect of alternative climate scenarios on the pinon-juniper ecosystem and found that warmer and drier climate reduced productivity and increased the risk of drought-induced mortality, especially for pinon. We concluded that the direct links between fundamental drivers and growth rates in our model hold great promise to improve our understanding of ecosystem processes under climate change and improve management decisions because of its greater reliance on first principles.},

	abstract = {Increased droughts due to regional shifts in temperature and rainfall regimes are likely to affect forests in temperate regions in the coming decades. To assess their consequences for forest dynamics, we need predictive tools that couple hydrologic processes, soil moisture dynamics and plant productivity. Here, we developed and tested a dynamic forest model that predicts the hydrologic balance of North Patagonian rainforests on Chiloe Island, in temperate South America (42 degrees S). The model incorporates the dynamic linkages between changing rainfall regimes, soil moisture and individual tree growth. Declining rainfall, as predicted for the study area, should mean up to 50\% less summer rain by year 2100. We analysed forest responses to increased drought using the model proposed focusing on changes in evapotranspiration, soil moisture and forest structure (above-ground biomass and basal area). We compared the responses of a young stand (YS, ca. 60 years-old) and an old-growth forest (OG, {\textgreater}500 years-old) in the same area. Based on detailed field measurements of water fluxes, the model provides a reliable account of the hydrologic balance of these evergreen, broad-leaved rainforests. We found higher evapotranspiration in OG than YS under current climate. Increasing drought predicted for this century can reduce evapotranspiration by 15\% in the OG compared to current values. Drier climate will alter forest structure, leading to decreases in above ground biomass by 27\% of the current value in OG. The model presented here can be used to assess the potential impacts of climate change on forest hydrology and other threats of global change on future forests such as fragmentation, introduction of exotic tree species, and changes in fire regimes. Our study expands the applicability of forest dynamics models in remote and hitherto overlooked regions of the world, such as southern temperate rainforests.},

@book{haarerModernCoffeeProduction1956,
	title = {Modern coffee production},
	abstract = {A book about coffee usually makes interesting reading and the present volume is no exception. In the first chapter a full and often picturesque account is given of the introduction of coffee from its original Ethiopian home to the countries of the East and later to the New World, whence it was introduced once more to Kenya, Nyasa-land and other African territories. It is shown that most of the coffee that moved about the world was derived from two original strains, the type species Coffea arabica var. arabica and the strain introduced by the French into the island of Réunion at Bourbon, which has come to be known as C. arabica var. bourbon; from these two strains many mutants and local variations have later arisen. In discussing the complexities of the systematics of the genus Coffea, the author suggests that all the coffees grown commercially can be assigned to the species C. arabica, C. canephora, C. liberica and C. excelsa, C. robusta being regarded as a form of C. canephora. A full account is given of these four species and their forms, and of a number of species of lesser economic importance, some from Africa and some from Asia. In chapter III the author emphasizes the importance of a knowledge of the genetics and cytology of a genus for its improvement by breeding methods and gives an outline of what is known on these subjects from the published literature on coffee; special reference is made to the work carried out by Krug and others in Brazil at the Institute of Agronomy at Campinas, all of which will be familiar to readers of Plant Breeding Abstracts. The importance of Kent's coffee from India in making it possible to grow Arabian coffees in areas infected with leaf rust and other diseases receives particular mention. Conditions of environment suitable to different types of coffee are examined in the next two chapters, and in chapter VI, devoted to propagation from seed and the factors that should be taken into consideration in selecting mother trees, emphasis is laid on the importance of the environment in determining whether a given strain of coffee will do well or not in any given locality; in this chapter brief outlines are given of practical breeding work that has been carried out in Africa, India, Java and elsewhere; methods of raising seedlings are also described, questions of vegetative reproduction being discussed in the following chapter. Care and maintenance of coffee plantations, harvesting and preparation are next dealt with and there follow two chapters devoted respectively to diseases and pests of coffee. The remainder of the book is concerned with the statistics and economics of production. The volume is well and copiously illustrated and each chapter is provided with a selected list of works for further reading.},

Although the main focus is on projections of accelerated springtime phenological events, also a further extension of the growing season by delayed growth cessation is often projected. However, ecophysiological studies indicate that, for boreal and temperate trees, such generalisations are precluded owing to differential climatic conditions and inter- and intraspecific genetic differences. The annual cycle of these trees is an integrated system, where one phase affects subsequent phases, resulting in delayed impacts, which are only partially addressed in current ecophysiological models. Here, we outline an updated integrated conceptual model of the annual cycle by identifying ecophysiological phenomena that are particularly significant under climate warming.},

	abstract = {Changes in temperature, CO2, and precipitation under the scenarios of climate change for the next 30 yr present a challenge to crop production. This review focuses on the impact of temperature, CO2, and ozone on agronomic crops and the implications for crop production. Understanding these implications for agricultural crops is critical for developing cropping systems resilient to stresses induced by climate change. There is variation among crops in their response to CO2, temperature, and precipitation changes and, with the regional differences in predicted climate, a situation is created in which the responses will be further complicated. For example, the temperature effects on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] could potentially cause yield reductions of 2.4\% in the South but an increase of 1.7\% in the Midwest. The frequency of years when temperatures exceed thresholds for damage during critical growth stages is likely to increase for some crops and regions. The increase in CO2 contributes significantly to enhanced plant growth and improved water use efficiency (WUE); however, there may be a downscaling of these positive impacts due to higher temperatures plants will experience during their growth cycle. A challenge is to understand the interactions of the changing climatic parameters because of the interactions among temperature, CO2, and precipitation on plant growth and development and also on the biotic stresses of weeds, insects, and diseases. Agronomists will have to consider the variations in temperature and precipitation as part of the production system if they are to ensure the food security required by an ever increasing population.},

	abstract = {Model simulations of the next few decades are widely used in assessments of climate change impacts and as guidance for adaptation. Their non-linear nature reveals a level of irreducible uncertainty which it is important to understand and quantify, especially for projections of near-term regional climate. Here we use large idealised initial condition ensembles of the FAMOUS global climate model with a 1 \%/year compound increase in \$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{CO\}\_2\$\$ CO 2 levels to quantify the range of future temperatures in model-based projections. These simulations explore the role of both atmospheric and oceanic initial conditions and are the largest such ensembles to date. Short-term simulated trends in global temperature are diverse, and cooling periods are more likely to be followed by larger warming rates. The spatial pattern of near-term temperature change varies considerably, but the proportion of the surface showing a warming is more consistent. In addition, ensemble spread in inter-annual temperature declines as the climate warms, especially in the North Atlantic. Over Europe, atmospheric initial condition uncertainty can, for certain ocean initial conditions, lead to 20 year trends in winter and summer in which every location can exhibit either strong cooling or rapid warming. However, the details of the distribution are highly sensitive to the ocean initial condition chosen and particularly the state of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. On longer timescales, the warming signal becomes more clear and consistent amongst different initial condition ensembles. An ensemble using a range of different oceanic initial conditions produces a larger spread in temperature trends than ensembles using a single ocean initial condition for all lead times. This highlights the potential benefits from initialising climate predictions from ocean states informed by observations. These results suggest that climate projections need to be performed with many more ensemble members than at present, using a range of ocean initial conditions, if the uncertainty in near-term regional climate is to be adequately quantified.},

Those datasets are particularly important for Central America because they allow the conception of climate variability and climate change studies in a region of high climatic heterogeneity and at the same time aid the decisionmaking process at the local scale (municipalities and districts). Tavg data from stations and complementary gridded datasets at 50 km resolution were used to generate a high-resolution (5 km grid) dataset for Central America from 1970 to 1999. A highresolution P dataset was used along with the new Tavg dataset to study climate variability and a climate change application. Consistently with other studies, it was found that the 1970-1999 trends in P are generally non-significant, with the exception of a few small locations. In the case of Tavg, there were significant warming trends in most of Central America, and cooling trends in Honduras and northern Panama. When the sea surface temperature anomalies between the Tropical Pacific and the Tropical Atlantic have different (same) sign, they are a good indicator of the sign of P (Tavg) annual anomalies. Even with non-significant trends in precipitation, the significant warming trends in Tavg in most of Central America can have severe consequences in the hydrology and water availability of the region, as the warming would bring increases in evapotranspiration, drier soils and higher aridity.},

	abstract = {The strong trends in climate change already evident, the likelihood of further changes occurring, and the increasing scale of potential climate impacts give urgency to addressing agricultural adaptation more coherently. There are many potential adaptation options available for marginal change of existing agricultural systems, often variations of existing climate risk management. We show that implementation of these options is likely to have substantial benefits under moderate climate change for some cropping systems. However, there are limits to their effectiveness under more severe climate changes. Hence, more systemic changes in resource allocation need to be considered, such as targeted diversification of production systems and livelihoods. We argue that achieving increased adaptation action will necessitate integration of climate change-related issues with other risk factors, such as climate variability and market risk, and with other policy domains, such as sustainable development. Dealing with the many barriers to effective adaptation will require a comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a range of scales and issues, for example, from the understanding by farmers of change in risk profiles to the establishment of efficient markets that facilitate response strategies. Science, too, has to adapt. Multidisciplinary problems require multidisciplinary solutions, i.e., a focus on integrated rather than disciplinary science and a strengthening of the interface with decision makers. A crucial component of this approach is the implementation of adaptation assessment frameworks that are relevant, robust, and easily operated by all stakeholders, practitioners, policymakers, and scientists.},

Remote sensing of CCC is vital for a wide range of ecological and agricultural applications. The objectives of this study were to explore simple and robust algorithms for spectral assessment of CCC. Hyperspectral datasets for six vegetation types (rice, wheat, corn, soybean, sugar beet and natural grass) acquired in four locations (Japan, France, Italy and USA) were analysed. To explore the best predictive model, spectral index approaches using the entire wavebands and multivariable regression approaches were employed. The comprehensive analysis elucidated the accuracy, linearity, sensitivity and applicability of various spectral models. Multivariable regression models using many wavebands proved inferior in applicability to different datasets. A simple model using the ratio spectral index (RSI; R815, R704) with the reflectance at 815 and 704 nm showed the highest accuracy and applicability. Simulation analysis using a physically based reflectance model suggested the biophysical soundness of the results. The model would work as a robust algorithm for canopy-chlorophyll-metre and/or remote sensing of CCC in ecosystem and regional scales. The predictive-ability maps using hyperspectral data allow not only evaluation of the relative significance of wavebands in various sensors but also selection of the optimal wavelengths and effective bandwidths.},

For this purpose, we integrated transcriptomic and metabolite analyses, combining real-time RT-PCR performed on 137 selected genes (of which 79 were uncharacterized in Coffea) and metabolite profiling. * Our map-drawing approach derived from model plants enabled us to propose a rationale for the peculiar traits of the coffee endosperm, such as its unusual fatty acid composition, remarkable accumulation of chlorogenic acid and cell wall polysaccharides. * Comparison with the developmental features of exalbuminous seeds described in the literature revealed that the two seed types share important regulatory mechanisms for reserve biosynthesis, independent of the origin and ploidy level of the storage tissue.},

	abstract = {Canopy photosynthesis has typically been estimated using mathematical models that have the following assumptions: the light interception inside the canopy exponentially declines with the canopy depth, and the photosynthetic capacity is affected by light interception as a result of acclimation. However, in actual situations, light interception in the canopy is quite heterogenous depending on environmental factors such as the location, microclimate, leaf area index, and canopy architecture. It is important to apply these factors in an analysis. The objective of the current study is to estimate the canopy photosynthesis of paprika (Capsicum annuum L.) with an analysis of by simulating the intercepted irradiation of the canopy using a 3D ray-tracing and photosynthetic capacity in each layer. By inputting the structural data of an actual plant, the 3D architecture of paprika was reconstructed using graphic software (Houdini FX, FX, Canada). The light curves and A/C(i) curve of each layer were measured to parameterize the Farquhar, von Caemmerer, and Berry (FvCB) model. The difference in photosynthetic capacity within the canopy was observed. With the intercepted irradiation data and photosynthetic parameters of each layer, the values of an entire plant's photosynthesis rate were estimated by integrating the calculated photosynthesis rate at each layer. The estimated photosynthesis rate of an entire plant showed good agreement with the measured plant using a closed chamber for validation. From the results, this method was considered as a reliable tool to predict canopy photosynthesis using light interception, and can be extended to analyze the canopy photosynthesis in actual greenhouse conditions.},

	abstract = {A strong positive correlation between vegetation canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) in the near infrared (NIR) spectral region and foliar mass-based nitrogen concentration (\%N) has been reported in some temperate and boreal forests. This relationship, if true, would indicate an additional role for nitrogen in the climate system via its influence on surface albedo and may offer a simple approach for monitoring foliar nitrogen using satellite data. We report, however, that the previously reported correlation is an artifact--it is a consequence of variations in canopy structure, rather than of \%N. The data underlying this relationship were collected at sites with varying proportions of foliar nitrogen-poor needleleaf and nitrogen-rich broadleaf species, whose canopy structure differs considerably. When the BRF data are corrected for canopy-structure effects, the residual reflectance variations are negatively related to \%N at all wavelengths in the interval 423-855 nm. This suggests that the observed positive correlation between BRF and \%N conveys no information about \%N. We find that to infer leaf biochemical constituents, e.g., N content, from remotely sensed data, BRF spectra in the interval 710-790 nm provide critical information for correction of structural influences. Our analysis also suggests that surface characteristics of leaves impact remote sensing of its internal constituents. This further decreases the ability to remotely sense canopy foliar nitrogen. Finally, the analysis presented here is generic to the problem of remote sensing of leaf-tissue constituents and is therefore not a specific critique of articles espousing remote sensing of foliar \%N.},

	abstract = {Most land surface and ecosystem models assume that a vegetated canopy can be abstracted as a turbid medium when such models compute mass, energy, and carbon exchange. However, those models fail to simulate radiation environments in heterogeneous landscapes. This study aims to couple a spatially explicit three-dimensional (3D) shortwave and longwave radiative transfer model with a soil and canopy energy balance and canopy physiology model (CANOAK-FLiES), to investigate how well the 3D model performs in a heterogeneous landscape compared to a 1D model. The canopy structural parameters were extracted using airborne-based Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and digital cover photographs. The developed model was compared with a wide variety of field and remote sensing data (e.g., hyper-spectral remote sensing images, overstory and understory radiation, and tower-based energy and CO2 fluxes) in a woody oak savanna in CA, USA. Overall, the simulated spatial and diurnal patterns of the radiation environment were consistent with the measurements of shortwave and longwave wavebands. The 3D approach worked better than the 1D approach from the wet mild spring to the dry hot summer while the relative importance of using the 3D approach depends on climate and canopy physiological conditions as well as the canopy structure. With low leaf area index in the oak woodland, the woody elements absorbed 12\%–39\% of the PAR and 20\%–52\% of the NIR radiation. Consequently, 12\% of the daytime energy flux was used as woody heat storage at our study site. This novel 3D model has the potential to serve as a useful tool for analyzing the spatio-temporal variability of radiation and energy fluxes in evaluating footprints of radiation sensors and eddy covariance fluxes, and serve as a standard in evaluating the performance of a hierarchy of simpler land surface models to compute mass and energy exchange of heterogeneous landscapes.},

	abstract = {The model EFIMOD 2 was developed for the description of tree (stand) growth and biological turnover of elements in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. The model has the following features. (i) It is a spatially explicit stand-level simulator for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) and Pendula birch (Betula pendula L.) on different forest soils growing under different climatic conditions in Europe; each stand consists of individual trees for which growth is modelled depending on the tree’s position within the stand and local light, water and available nutrient conditions. (ii) The model has a tree-based submodel for total biomass distributed between several biomass compartments. (iii) The calculations include natural regeneration as well as ground vegetation dynamics. (iv) The soil submodel (ROMUL) is used to assess organic matter dynamics and nitrogen availability for tree growth as a function of soil temperature, soil moisture content and litter quality. (v) EFIMOD 2 calculates nitrogen cycling and accounts for atmospheric nitrogen deposition, nitrogen fixation and leaching, vegetation uptake, litter fall and nitrogen redistribution within and between trees and soil horizons. (vi) Monte–Carlo simulations are done to simulate the extent of naturally oscillating variability. EFIMOD 2 allows for short-term and long-term simulations of natural and managed forest ecosystem dynamics over a wide range of forest sites, climatic conditions and silvicultural regimes. The model calculates dendrometric parameters for every tree, including undergrowth and seedlings, total growing stock, and pools of coarse woody debris and soil organic matter, with special reference to carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The model is effective for assessing wood productivity and evaluation of forest management regimes to meet criteria and indicators of Sustainable Forest Management. This includes a general evaluation of biodiversity and soil sustainability. The model system allows for the direct use of standard forest inventory data. Output variables include carbon and nitrogen pools in the stand and soil, CO2 emissions, and tree (stand) growth and yield.},

	abstract = {Clonal plantations of Eucalyptus have been introduced since 1978 on savanna soils of the coastal plains of Congo. Atmospheric deposition, canopy exchange and transfer through the soil were estimated on the whole rooting depth (6m) over 3 years, in an experimental design installed in a native savanna and an adjacent 6-year-old Eucalyptus plantation. Complementary measurements after planting the experimental savanna made it possible to establish input–output budgets of nutrients for the whole Eucalyptus rotation and to compare them with the native savanna ecosystem. In this highly-weathered soil, atmospheric deposits and symbiotic N fixation by a legume species balanced the nutrient budgets in savanna, despite large losses during annual burnings. After afforestation, weeding in the Eucalyptus stands eliminated the leguminous species responsible for a N input by symbiotic fixation of about 20kgha−1year−1. Whereas the budgets of P, K, Ca and Mg were roughly balanced, the current silviculture led to a deficit of about 140kgNha−1 in the soil, throughout a 7-year rotation. This deficit was large relative to the pool of total N in the upper soil layer (0–50cm), which was about 2tha−1. Therefore, the sustainability of Congolese plantations will require an increase in N fertilizer inputs over successive rotations to balance the N budget. These results were consistent with field trials of fertilization. Practical consequences of these budgets were identified, in order to: (i) direct field trials of fertilization, (ii) select appropriate methods of soil preparation, weed control and harvest, (iii) highlight the importance of fire prevention in this area, and (iv) support the implementation of field trials aiming at introducing a biological nitrogen fixing understorey in Eucalyptus stands.},

Several regional studies demonstrate the climate sensitivity of coffee (Coffea arabica) and the likely impact of climate change on coffee suitability, yield, increased pest and disease pressure and farmers’ livelihoods. The objectives of this paper are (i) to quantify the impact of progressive climate change to grow coffee and to produce high quality coffee in Nicaragua and (ii) to develop an adaptation framework across time and space to guide adaptation planning. We used coffee location and cup quality data from Nicaragua in combination with the Maxent and CaNaSTA crop suitability models, the WorldClim historical data and the CMIP3 global circulation models to predict the likely impact of climate change on coffee suitability and quality. We distinguished four different impact scenarios: Very high (coffee disappears), high (large negative changes), medium (little negative changes) and increase (positive changes) in climate suitability. During the Nicaraguan coffee roundtable, most promising adaptation strategies were identified, which we then used to develop a two-dimensional adaptation framework for coffee in time and space. Our analysis indicates that incremental adaptation may occur over short-term horizons at lower altitudes, whereas the same areas may undergo transformative adaptation in the longer term. At higher elevations incremental adaptation may be needed in the long term. The same principle and framework is applicable across coffee growing regions around the world.},

	doi = {10.1080/07352689891304249},
	abstract = {Soil erosion is a global issue because of its severe adverse economic and environmental impacts. Economic impacts on productivity may be due to direct effects on crops/plants on-site and off-site, and environmental consequences are primarily off-site due either to pollution of natural waters or adverse effects on air quality due to dust and emissions of radiatively active gases. Off-site economic effects of erosion are related to the damage to civil structure, siltation of water ways and reservoirs, and additional costs involved in water treatment. There are numerous reports regarding the on-site effects of erosion on productivity. However, a vast majority of these are from the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Europe, and only a few from soils of the tropics and subtropics. On-site effects of erosion on agronomic productivity are assessed with a wide range of methods, which can be broadly grouped into three categories: agronomic/soil quality evaluation, economic assessment, and knowledge surveys. Agronomic methods involve greenhouse and field experiments to assess erosion-induced changes in soil quality in relation to productivity. A widely used technique is to establish field plots on the same soil series but with different severity of past erosion. Different erosional phases must be located on the same landscape position. Impact of past erosion on productivity can also be assessed by relating plant growth to the depth of a root-restrictive horizon. Impact of current erosion rate on productivity can be assessed using field runoff plots or paired watersheds, and that of future erosion using topsoil removal and addition technique. Economic evaluation of the on-site impact involves assessment of the losses of plant available water and nutrients and other additional inputs needed due to erosion. Knowledge surveys are conducted as a qualitative substitute for locations where quantitative data are not available. Results obtained from these different techniques are not comparable, and there is a need to standardize the methods and develop scaling procedures to extrapolate the data from plot or soil level to regional and global scale. There is also a need to assess on-site impact of erosion in relation to soil loss tolerance, soil life, soil resilience or ease of restoration, and soil management options for sustainable use of soil and water resources. Restoration of degraded soils is a high global priority. If about 1.5?109?ha of soils in the world prone to erosion can be managed to effectively control soil erosion, it would improve air and water quality, sequester C in the pedosphere at the rate of about 1.5?Pg/year, and increase food production. The risks of global annual loss of food production due to accelerated erosion may be as high as 190?106?Mg of cereals, 6?106?Mg of soybeans, 3?106?Mg of pulses, and 73?106?Mg of roots and tubers. The actual loss may depend on weather conditions during the growing season, farming systems, soil management, and soil ameliorative input used. Erosion-caused losses of food production are most severe in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and elsewhere in the tropics rather than in other regions.},

	abstract = {The uncertainties of transpiration calculations with the Penman–Monteith equation were quantified under different climate conditions of Brazil, Germany and Israel using maize as a common crop type. All experiments were carried out under non-limiting growing conditions. Canopy resistance was determined by scaling to canopy level specific relations between in situ measurements of incident radiation and stomatal conductance using a light penetration model. The model was tested against heat-pulse measured sap flow in plant stems. The root mean square error (RMSE) of daily calculated transpiration minus measured sap flow was 0.4mm/day. It was dominated by its variance component (variance=0.2 \{mm/day\}2; bias=0.0mm/day). Calculated transpiration closely matched the measured trends at the three locations. No significant differences were found between seasons and locations. Uncertainties of canopy conductance parameterizations led to errors of up to 2.1mm/day. The model responded most sensitively to a 30\% change of net radiation (absolute bias error=1.6mm/day), followed by corresponding alterations of canopy resistances (0.8mm/day), vapour pressure deficits (0.5mm/day) and aerodynamic resistances (0.34mm/day). Measured and calculated 30-min or hourly averaged transpiration rates are highly correlated (r2=0.95; n=10634), and the slope of the regression line is close to unity. The overall RMSE of calculated transpiration minus measured sap flow was 0.08mm/h and was dominated by its variance component (0.005 \{mm/h\}2). Measured sap flow consistently lagged behind calculated transpiration, because plant hydraulic capacitance delays the change of leaf water potential that drives water uptake. Calculated transpiration significantly overestimated sap flow during morning hours (mean=0.068mm/h, n=321) and underestimated it during afternoon hours (mean=−0.065mm/h; n=316). The Penman–Monteith approach as implemented in the present study is sufficiently sensitive to detect small differences between transpiration and water uptake and provides a robust tool to manage plant water supply under unstressed conditions.},

	abstract = {The model-based analysis of the effects of management options at stand and regional levels on forest functions such as carbon storage and groundwater recharge provides a basis for optimisation of forest planning under global change. The physiologically based model 4C (‘FORESEE’—FORESt Ecosystems in a changing Environment) can be used to evaluate a broad variety of silvicultural treatments for mono- and mixed-species forest stands. In this study, we present the testing and evaluation of the 4C management submodel, using data from long-term experimental plots in selected stands in the Federal State of Brandenburg, Germany. Comparison of experimental data with model simulations, by means of diameter distributions, demonstrated that the applied thinning operations preserved the diameter distribution of the stands. 4C realistically described the effects of management options on stand dynamics as proved by long-term simulations. Furthermore, the investigation of the effects of management options, thinning intensity, and rotation length on carbon storage in biomass and soil, yield, and groundwater recharge showed the applicability of the model 4C for the evaluation of forest functions in managed forests. We present the analysis of management effects on forest functions at a regional scale, based on a grid of forest monitoring sites (“Ökologische Waldzustandskontrolle”—ÖWK) in Brandenburg, which is mainly dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The model was applied at the sites with three management options under current climate and a climate change scenario (i.e., temperature increase of 1.4 °K by 2055). The results of 50-year simulation runs were analysed for forest growth units with respect to total carbon storage (Csum) and groundwater recharge. More intensive management decreased the Csum after 50 years and slightly increased groundwater recharge. Climate change led to a reduction of groundwater recharge by about 40\%, averaged over all sites. Csum was increased at some sites because of the extension of the growing season in spite of slight decreases in precipitation, but at several other sites, Csum decreased due to increased dryness. The question arises whether these negative effects of climate change can be minimised by adaptive management operations. In this study, we concluded that the potentials of adaptive management based on changes in rotation length and thinning is very limited in this region, which is characterised by poor sites and dry climatic conditions. We concluded that it is necessary to include forest transformation strategies in management impact analyses for forest planning under global change.},

	abstract = {Leaf area and its spatial distribution are key canopy parameters needed to model the radiation regime within a forest and to compute the mass and energy exchange between a forest and the atmosphere. A much larger proportion of available net radiation is received at the forest floor in open-canopy forests than in closed-canopy forests. The proportion of ecosystem water vapor exchange (λE) and sensible heat exchange from the forest floor is therefore expected to be larger in open-canopy forests than in closed-canopy forests.We used a combination of optical and canopy geometry measurements, and robust one- and three-dimensional models to evaluate the influence of canopy architecture and radiative transfer on estimates of carbon, water and energy exchange of a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forest. Three-dimensional model simulations showed that the average probability of diffuse and direct radiation transmittance to the forest floor was greater than if a random distribution of foliage had been assumed. Direct and diffuse radiation transmittance to the forest floor was 28 and 39\%, respectively, in the three-dimensional model simulations versus 23 and 31\%, respectively, in the one-dimensional model simulations. The assumption of randomly distributed foliage versus inclusion of clumping factors in a one-dimensional, multi-layer biosphere-atmosphere gas exchange model (CANVEG) had the greatest effect on simulated annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and soil evaporation. Assuming random distribution, NEE was 41\% lower, net photosynthesis 3\% lower, total λE 10\% lower, and soil evaporation 40\% lower. The same comparisons at LAI 5 showed a similar effect on annual NEE estimates (37\%) and λE (12\%), but a much larger effect on net photosynthesis (20\%), suggesting that, at low LAI, canopies are mostly sunlit, so that redistribution of light has little effect on net photosynthesis, whereas the effect on net photosynthesis is much greater at high LAIs.},

	doi = {10.1093/aob/mcp216},
	abstract = {Background and AimsDespite its simple architecture and small phenotypic plasticity, oil palm has complex phenology and source–sink interactions. Phytomers appear in regular succession but their development takes years, involving long lag periods between environmental influences and their effects on sinks. Plant adjustments to resulting source–sink imbalances are poorly understood. This study investigated oil palm adjustments to imbalances caused by severe fruit pruning.MethodsAn experiment with two treatments (control and complete fruit pruning) during 22 months in 2006–2008) and six replications per treatment was conducted in Indonesia. Phenology, growth of above-ground vegetative and reproductive organs, leaf morphology, inflorescence sex differentiation, dynamics of non-structural carbohydrate reserves and light-saturated net photosynthesis (Amax) were monitored.Key ResultsArtificial sink limitation by complete fruit pruning accelerated development rate, resulting in higher phytomer, leaf and inflorescence numbers. Leaf size and morphology remained unchanged. Complete fruit pruning also suppressed the abortion of male inflorescences, estimated to be triggered at about 16 months before bunch maturity. The number of female inflorescences increased after an estimated lag of 24–26 months, corresponding to time from sex differentiation to bunch maturity. The most important adjustment process was increased assimilate storage in the stem, attaining nearly 50 \% of dry weight in the stem top, mainly as starch, whereas glucose, which in controls was the most abundant non-structural carbohydrate stored in oil palm, decreased.ConclusionsThe development rate of oil palm is in part controlled by source–sink relationships. Although increased rate of development and proportion of female inflorescences constituted observed adjustments to sink limitation, the low plasticity of plant architecture (constant leaf size, absence of branching) limited compensatory growth. Non-structural carbohydrate storage was thus the main adjustment process.},

	doi = {10.1093/treephys/tpp057},
	abstract = {Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is a perennial, tropical, monocotyledonous plant characterized by simple architecture and low phenotypic plasticity, but marked by long development cycles of individual phytomers (a pair of one leaf and one inflorescence at its axil). Environmental effects on vegetative or reproductive sinks occur with various time lags depending on the process affected, causing source–sink imbalances. This study investigated how the two instantaneous sources of carbon assimilates, CO2 assimilation and mobilization of transitory non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) reserves, may buffer such imbalances. An experiment was conducted in Indonesia during a 22-month period (from July 2006 to May 2008) at two contrasting locations (Kandista and Batu Mulia) using two treatments (control and complete fruit pruning treatment) in Kandista. Measurements included leaf gas exchange, dynamics of NSC reserves and dynamics of structural aboveground vegetative growth (SVG) and reproductive growth. Drought was estimated from a simulated fraction of transpirable soil water. The main sources of variation in source–sink relationships were (i) short-term reductions in light-saturated leaf CO2 assimilation rate (Amax) during seasonal drought periods, particularly in Batu Mulia; (ii) rapid responses of SVG rate to drought; and (iii) marked lag periods between 16 and 29 months of environmental effects on the development of reproductive sinks. The resulting source–sink imbalances were buffered by fluctuations in NSC reserves in the stem, which mainly consisted of glucose and starch. Starch was the main buffer for sink variations, whereas glucose dynamics remained unexplained. Even under strong sink limitation, no negative feedback on Amax was observed. In conclusion, the different lag periods for environmental effects on assimilate sources and sinks in oil palm are mainly buffered by NSC accumulation in the stem, which can attain 50\% (dw:dw) in stem tops. The resulting dynamics of growth and production are complex because several dozen phytomers of different phenological ages develop at any given time and interact with a common pool of reserves.},

Hot environments are therefore said to favour selection for small, narrow or dissected leaves. Empirical evidence from real leaves under field conditions is scant and traditionally based on point measurements that do not capture spatial variation in heat load. We used thermal imagery under field conditions to measure the leaf thermal time constant (tau) in summer and the leaf-to-air temperature difference (T) and temperature range across laminae (Trange ) during winter, autumn and summer for 68 Proteaceae species. We investigated the influence of leaf area and margin complexity relative to effective leaf width (we ), the latter being a more direct indicator of boundary layer thickness. Normalized difference of margin complexity had no or weak effects on thermal dynamics, but we strongly predicted tau and T, whereas leaf area influenced Trange . Unlike artificial leaves, however, spatial temperature distribution in large leaves appeared to be governed largely by structural variation. Therefore, we agree that small size, specifically we , has adaptive value in hot environments but not with the idea that thermal regulation is the primary evolutionary driver of leaf dissection.},

	abstract = {Thermal imaging is a potential tool for estimating plant temperature, which can be used as an indicator of stomatal closure and water deficit stress. In this study, a new method for processing and analysing thermal images was developed. By using remote sensing software, the information from thermal and visible images was combined, the images were classified to identify leaf area and sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy, and the temperature statistics for specific canopy components were calculated. The method was applied to data from a greenhouse water‐stress experiment of Vicia faba L. and to field data for Vitis vinifera L. Vaseline‐covered and water‐sprayed plants were used as dry and wet references, respectively, and two thermal indices, based on temperature differences between the canopy and reference surfaces, were calculated for single Vicia faba plants. The thermal indices were compared with measured stomatal conductance. The temperature distributions of sunlit and shaded leaf area of Vitis vinifera canopies from natural rainfall and irrigation treatments were compared. The present method provides two major improvements compared with earlier methods for calculating thermal indices. First, it allows more accurate estimation of the indices, which are consequently more closely related to stomatal conductance. Second, it gives more accurate estimates of the temperature distribution of the shaded and sunlit parts of canopy, and, unlike the earlier methods, makes it possible to quantify the relationship between temperature variation and stomatal conductance.},

	abstract = {Forest canopies play a major role in biosphere—atmosphere interaction. Their actual temperature may deviate substantially from ambient atmospheric conditions as reported by weather stations. While there is a long tradition of false-colour imagery, new digital technologies in combination with IR transmission lenses and autocalibration routines permit unprecedented insight into the actual temperature regimes in canopies. We report canopy leaf temperature distribution over space and time assessed over a 35 m tall mixed deciduous forest in NW Switzerland by means of a construction crane and a high resolution thermal camera. At an air temperature of 25 ° C, conifers (Picea abies, Pinus sylverstris and Larix decidua) and deciduous broad-leaved trees with exceptionally high transpiration (Quercus petraea) or very open, low density canopies (Prunus avium) exhibited mean canopy leaf temperatures close to air temperature (0.3–2.7 K above ambient) and the maximum amplitude within a given crown reached 6–9 K. In contrast, broad-leaved deciduous species with dense canopies (Fagus sylvatica, Carpinus betulus and Tilia platyphyllos) were 4.5–5 K warmer than air temperature and showed within canopy temperature amplitudes of 10–12 K. Calculated leaf boundary resistance was clearly lower for conifers (3–24 m s−1) than for broad-leaved trees (33–64 m s−1). The study illustrates that mean leaf temperatures in forest trees are not adequately explained by either stomatal conductance or leaf dimensions, but strongly depend on canopy architecture (leaf area density, branching habits) in combination with leaf traits. Aerodynamic leaf and canopy characteristics lead to strongly enhanced vapour pressure gradients (evaporative forcing) and leaf temperatures vary enormously over short distances, calling for statistical temperature models (frequency distribution) rather than the use of means in any flux calculations. The presence/absence of certain tree taxa plays a key role in forest surface temperature.},

Proceeding from the fact that most existing patch models have proven to generate reliable results with respect to species compositions at regional scales, PICUS v1.2 is intended to provide spatially explicit site-specific decision support to forest resource managers regarding long-term vegetation development in heterogeneous alpine landscapes. The model is based on a 3D-core structure which allows the spatially explicit simultaneous simulation of several hectares of multiple species forests. Special emphasis is given to (i) the implementation of a light model for both direct and diffuse radiation, (ii) to the modification of the temperature and soil moisture response functions, which have been parameterised based on the combined network of large-scale forest inventory data and meteorological data, and (iii) the development of a fuzzy logic control unit to model the effect of site nutrient status on vegetation development. As a first test PICUS v1.2 is applied to simulate equilibrium species composition spatially explicit in heterogeneous alpine landscapes at sample plots of the Austrian Forest Soil Survey along a transect through the Eastern Alps.},

There is striking agreement between Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) observed and AMIP5 simulated P anomalies over land both globally and in the tropics suggesting that prescribed sea surface temperature and realistic radiative forcings are sufficient for simulating the interannual variability in continental P. Differences between the observed and simulated P variability over the ocean, originate primarily from the wet tropical regions, in particular the western Pacific, but are reduced slightly after 1995. All datasets show positive responses of P to T globally of around 2\%/K for simulations and 3–4\%/K in GPCP observations but model responses over the tropical oceans are around 3 times smaller than GPCP over the period 1988–2005. The observed anticorrelation between land and ocean P, linked with El Niño Southern Oscillation, is captured by the simulations. All data sets over the tropical ocean show a tendency for wet regions to become wetter and dry regions drier with warming. Over the wet region (≥75\% precipitation percentile), the precipitation response is ∼13–15\%/K for GPCP and ∼5\%/K for models while trends in P are 2.4\%/decade for GPCP, 0.6\% /decade for CMIP5 and 0.9\%/decade for AMIP5 suggesting that models are underestimating the precipitation responses or a deficiency exists in the satellite datasets.},

This functional–structural plant model (FSPM) encompasses the entire soil-plant-atmosphere continuum with a sub-organ resolution. The model simulates the growth and development of an individual maize plant and the flux of water through the plant structure, from the rhizosphere to the leaf boundary layer. Leaf stomatal conductance and root radial and axial conductivities are considered as functions of local water potential. Finally, a simple carbon allocation rule is included in the model to allow the feedback effect of water deficit on plant growth. The model was successfully used to reproduce experimental plant hydraulic behavior in response to water deficit. The quantitative contribution of leaf conductance and root conductivities were assessed individually and in combination. Our results highlight the importance of regulating hydraulic properties in FSPM as these can strongly modify the water uptake dynamics and lead to emerging water uptake behaviors. The modeling results also indicate that plant hydraulic properties can theoretically be tailored to improve plant water use in challenging environments.},

	abstract = {Acclimations to low and high light levels are located in opposite extremes. We examined how the coffee plant (Coffea arabica), which is considered to be shade-demanding although it performs well under full sun exposure, can acclimate to a range of light regimens. We hypothesised that the growth and physiological performance depends on the total amount of light received by the plant per day and on the temporal order of diurnal variations in the light supply. The biomass accumulation and allocation and the key photosynthetic traits of pot-grown coffee seedlings were examined over a range of light treatments as follows: plants grown entirely under 100\%, 40\% or 10\% sunlight; plants grown at either 40\% or 10\% sunlight from sunrise to midday and then submitted to full sunlight until sunset; and plants grown under full sunlight from sunrise to midday and then submitted to either 40\% or 10\% sunlight throughout the afternoon. The total biomass increased linearly with the increasing total light supply; however, plants receiving high amounts of light in the morning grew more than those receiving high amounts of light in the afternoon. Extensive morphological changes (e.g., specific leaf areas and leaf area ratios) primarily responsive to total light rather than to diurnal light fluctuations or light quality, at a given light supply, were noted. In contrast, changes in the photosynthetic performance per unit leaf area among the treatments were narrower and apparently unrelated to carbohydrate accumulation or photoinhibition. Overall, we found a poor leaf-level physiological plasticity of traits to light. We suggest that adjustments in leaf number and leaf area, coupled with whole-plant physiological adjustments, could largely account for the differences in the biomass amongst treatments. We also suggest that coffee could be classified as a shade-tolerant species as its traits do not match the requirements of either a classic shade-avoiding or a classic shade-demanding species.},

Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space.

Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

Whereas climate change impacts on crops grown in monocultures can reasonably well be projected with process-based crop models, robust models for complex agroforestry systems are not available. Yet impact projections are needed because of the long planning horizons required for adequate management of tree-based ecosystems. This article explores available options for projecting climate change impacts on agroforestry systems, including the development of process-based models, species distribution modeling, climate analogue analysis and field testing in climate analogue locations. Challenges and opportunities of each approach are discussed.},

	abstract = {Agroforestry has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of its potential to reduce poverty, improve food security, reduce land degradation and mitigate climate change. However, progress in promoting agroforestry is held back because decision-makers lack reliable tools to accurately predict yields from tree-crop mixtures. Amongst the key challenges faced in developing such tools are the complexity of agroforestry, including interactions between various system components, and the large spatial domains and timescales over which trees and crops interact. A model that is flexible enough to simulate any agroforestry system globally should be able to address competition and complementarity above and below ground between trees and crops for light, water and nutrients. Most agroforestry practices produce multiple products including food, fiber and fuel, as well as income, shade and other ecosystem services, all of which need to be simulated for a comprehensive understanding of the overall system to emerge. Several agroforestry models and model families have been developed, including SCUAF, HyPAR, Hi-SAFE/Yield-SAFE and WaNuLCAS, but as of 2015 their use has remained limited for reasons including insufficient flexibility, restricted ability to simulate interactions, extensive parameterization needs or lack of model maintenance. An efficient approach to improving the flexibility and durability of agroforestry models is to integrate them into a well-established modular crop modeling framework like APSIM. This framework currently focuses on field-scale crops and pastures, but has the capability to reuse or interoperate with existing models including tree, livestock and landscape models, it uses parameters that are intuitive and relatively easy to measure, and it allows scenario analysis that can include farm-scale economics. Various types of agroforestry systems are currently being promoted in many contexts, and the impacts of these innovations are often unclear. Rapid progress in reliable modeling of tree and crop performance for such systems is needed to ensure that agroforestry fulfills its potential to contribute to reducing poverty, improving food security and fostering sustainability.},

This could lead to the establishment of coffee plantations in new areas and potential conflicts with other land covers including natural forest, with consequent implications for biodiversity and ecosystem services. We project areas suitable for future coffee cultivation based on several climate scenarios and expected responses of the coffee berry borer, a principle pest of coffee crops. We show that the global climatically-suitable area will suffer marked shifts from some current major centres of cultivation. Most areas will be suited to Robusta coffee, demand for which could be met without incurring forest encroachment. The cultivation of Arabica, which represents 70\% of consumed coffee, can also be accommodated in the future, but only by incurring some natural forest loss. This has corresponding implications for carbon storage, and is likely to affect areas currently designated as priority areas for biodiversity. Where Arabica coffee does encroach on natural forests, we project average local losses of 35\% of threatened vertebrate species. The interaction of climate and coffee berry borer greatly influences projected outcomes.},

	abstract = {Ensembles of process-based crop models are increasingly used to simulate crop growth for scenarios of temperature and/or precipitation changes corresponding to different projections of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This approach generates large datasets with thousands of simulated crop yield data. Such datasets potentially provide new information but it is difficult to summarize them in a useful way due to their structural complexities. An associated issue is that it is not straightforward to compare crops and to interpolate the results to alternative climate scenarios not initially included in the simulation protocols. Here we demonstrate that statistical models based on random-coefficient regressions are able to emulate ensembles of process-based crop models. An important advantage of the proposed statistical models is that they can interpolate between temperature levels and between CO2 concentration levels, and can thus be used to calculate temperature and [CO2] thresholds leading to yield loss or yield gain, without re-running the original complex crop models. Our approach is illustrated with three yield datasets simulated by 19 maize models, 26 wheat models, and 13 rice models. Several statistical models are fitted to these datasets, and are then used to analyze the variability of the yield response to [CO2] and temperature. Based on our results, we show that, for wheat, a [CO2] increase is likely to outweigh the negative effect of a temperature increase of +2 °C in the considered sites. Compared to wheat, required levels of [CO2] increase are much higher for maize, and intermediate for rice. For all crops, uncertainties in simulating climate change impacts increase more with temperature than with elevated [CO2].},

In this contribution, the theory of water movement within the SPAC is reviewed with emphasis on the eco-physiological and evolutionary constraints to water transport. The description of the SPAC can be framed at two widely separated time scales: (i) sub-hourly to growing season scales, relevant for hydro-climatic effects on ecosystem fluxes (given a set of plant hydraulic traits), and (ii) inter-annual to centennial scales during which either hydraulic traits may change, as individuals grow and acclimate, or species composition may change. At the shorter time scales, water transport can be described by water balance equations where fluxes depend on the hydraulic features of the different compartments, encoded in the form of conductances that nonlinearly depend on water availability. Over longer time scales, ontogeny, acclimation, and shifts in species composition in response to environmental changes can impose constraints on these equations in the form of tradeoffs and coordinated changes in the hydraulic (and biochemical) parameters. Quantification of this evolutionary coordination and the related tradeoffs offers novel theoretical tactics to constrain hydrologic and biogeochemical models.},

	abstract = {Each year the area of fast-growing tree plantations in the world expands by around one million hectares. Concerns are rising regarding their influence on soil fertility and water resources. This thesis, as part of a project developed at the University of São Paulo, aims at studying the soil matrix and solution during the first two years of growth of an Eucalyptus Grandis stand to identify the drivers of the chemistry of the soil solution, quantify the water and nutrient fluxes leaving the ecosystem by deep drainage, and prepare reactive transport modeling using the MIN3P model. It is shown that (i) Eucalyptus trees took up large amounts of water starting from six months after planting, so that the water drainage at a depth of 3 m was largely reduced, (ii) almost no nutrient was leached below a depth of 3 m, (iii) part of the fertilizers was taken up by the Eucalyptus trees without appearing in soil solution, (iv) following clear cutting and fertilizing, large amounts of nutrients were released in the upper soil layers and leached down to a depth of 1 m (65-100 kg ha-1 of N-NO3) : acidification occurred in the upper soil layers but in such ferralsols, Al reserve and buffering capacity are still large, (v) S released by the fertilizers increased Ca, Mg and P mobilities, and decreased the H and Al release in soil solution, (vi) large quantities of S released by the fertilizers were adsorbed on the soil constituents, if this sulphate happens to be desorbed, greater soil acidification is to be expected. It is suggested that the amount of N brought by the fertilizers can be reduced without altering the stand productivity.
Chaque année, les plantations de ligneux à croissance rapide augmentent de près d'un million d'hectares dans le monde, menaçant selon certains la fertilité des sols et les ressources hydriques. Cette thèse s'attache, au sein d'un projet en cours à l'Université de São Paulo, à étudier le sol et la solution du sol pendant les deux premières années de croissance d'une plantation d'Eucalyptus grandis afin d'identifier les processus gouvernant la chimie de la solution du sol, de quantifier les flux d'eau et d'éléments minéraux sortant de l'écosystème par drainage profond, et de préparer la modélisation des transferts réactifs par le modèle MIN3P. On observe que (i) dès six mois, les Eucalyptus prélèvent de grandes quantités d'eau : le drainage à 3 m de profondeur en est largement réduit, (ii) les flux d'éléments minéraux à 3m sont pratiquement nuls, (iii) les éléments minéraux apportés par fertilisation sont en partie prélevés par les arbres sans apparaître dans la solution du sol, (iv) après la coupe rase et les fertilisations, les éléments minéraux sont libérés en quantité dans les horizons supérieurs du sol et lixiviés jusqu'à 1 m (65-100 kg ha-1 de N-NO3), des processus d'acidification apparaissent mais les réserves d'aluminium et le pouvoir tampon de ces ferralsols restent élevés, (v) le soufre libéré par les fertilisants augmente la mobilité de Ca, Mg et P et réduit la libération d'H et d'Al dans la solution, (vi) ce soufre se retrouve largement adsorbé sur les constituants du sol : son éventuelle désorption serait synonyme d'acidification. La fertilisation azotée de la plantation pourrait probablement être réduite sans en altérer la productivité.},

Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during these types of analyses.},

	abstract = {Modeling studies have predicted that coffee crop will be endangered by future global warming, but recent reports highlighted that high [CO2] can mitigate heat impacts on coffee. This work aimed at identifying heat protective mechanisms promoted by CO2 in Coffea arabica (cv. Icatu and IPR108) and Coffea canephora cv. Conilon CL153. Plants were grown at 25/20 degrees C (day/night), under 380 or 700 muL CO2 L(-1), and then gradually submitted to 31/25, 37/30, and 42/34 degrees C. Relevant heat tolerance up to 37/30 degrees C for both [CO2] and all coffee genotypes was observed, likely supported by the maintenance or increase of the pools of several protective molecules (neoxanthin, lutein, carotenes, alpha-tocopherol, HSP70, raffinose), activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), and the upregulated expression of some genes (ELIP, Chaperonin 20). However, at 42/34 degrees C a tolerance threshold was reached, mostly in the 380-plants and Icatu. Adjustments in raffinose, lutein, beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol and HSP70 pools, and the upregulated expression of genes related to protective (ELIPS, HSP70, Chape 20, and 60) and antioxidant (CAT, CuSOD2, APX Cyt, APX Chl) proteins were largely driven by temperature. However, enhanced [CO2] maintained higher activities of GR (Icatu) and CAT (Icatu and IPR108), kept (or even increased) the Cu,Zn-SOD, APX, and CAT activities, and promoted a greater upregulation of those enzyme genes, as well as those related to HSP70, ELIPs, Chaperonins in CL153, and Icatu. These changes likely favored the maintenance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at controlled levels and contributed to mitigate of photosystem II photoinhibition at the highest temperature. Overall, our results highlighted the important role of enhanced [CO2] on the coffee crop acclimation and sustainability under predicted future global warming scenarios.},

We examine the influence of hourly, daily, and monthly variance using the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 in conjunction with the long-term record of carbon fluxes measured at Harvard Forest. We find that fluctuations of sunlight and precipitation are strongly and nonlinearly coupled to ecosystem function, with effects that accumulate through annual and decadal timescales. Increasing variability in sunlight and precipitation leads to lower rates of carbon sequestration and favors broad-leaved deciduous trees over conifers. Temperature variability has only minor impacts by comparison. We also find that projected changes in sunlight and precipitation variability have important implications for carbon storage and ecosystem structure and composition. Based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change model estimates for changes in high-frequency meteorological variability over the next 100 years, we expect that terrestrial ecosystems will be affected by changes in variability almost as much as by changes in mean climate. We conclude that terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to high-frequency meteorological variability, and that accurate knowledge of the statistics of this variability is essential for realistic predictions of ecosystem structure and functioning.},

	abstract = {We present the greenhouse gas concentrations for the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and their extensions beyond 2100, the Extended Concentration Pathways (ECPs). These projections include all major anthropogenic greenhouse gases and are a result of a multi-year effort to produce new scenarios for climate change research. We combine a suite of atmospheric concentration observations and emissions estimates for greenhouse gases (GHGs) through the historical period (1750–2005) with harmonized emissions projected by four different Integrated Assessment Models for 2005–2100. As concentrations are somewhat dependent on the future climate itself (due to climate feedbacks in the carbon and other gas cycles), we emulate median response characteristics of models assessed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report using the reduced-complexity carbon cycle climate model MAGICC6. Projected ‘best-estimate’ global-mean surface temperature increases (using inter alia a climate sensitivity of 3°C) range from 1.5°C by 2100 for the lowest of the four RCPs, called both RCP3-PD and RCP2.6, to 4.5°C for the highest one, RCP8.5, relative to pre-industrial levels. Beyond 2100, we present the ECPs that are simple extensions of the RCPs, based on the assumption of either smoothly stabilizing concentrations or constant emissions: For example, the lower RCP2.6 pathway represents a strong mitigation scenario and is extended by assuming constant emissions after 2100 (including net negative CO2 emissions), leading to CO2 concentrations returning to 360 ppm by 2300. We also present the GHG concentrations for one supplementary extension, which illustrates the stringent emissions implications of attempting to go back to ECP4.5 concentration levels by 2250 after emissions during the 21st century followed the higher RCP6 scenario. Corresponding radiative forcing values are presented for the RCP and ECPs.},

	abstract = {Leaf respiration is a major component of the terrestrial carbon cycle, but is poorly quantified for tropical forests. We measured dark respiration, R, and nutrient concentration (nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P) of leaves within two forest canopies: in Reserva Jarú, south-west Brazil; and Mbalmayo Reserve, central Cameroon. The data, expressed on a leaf area basis (Ra, Na, Pa) and a leaf mass basis (Rm, Nm, Pm), were used to quantify the temperature sensitivity of R and to test the hypothesis that leaf metabolism is more strongly constrained by phosphorus than by nitrogen in these lowland rainforests.2Leaf respiration rate (Ra, at 25 °C) at Jarú was nearly half that at Mbalmayo (the range in Ra from near the ground to the upper canopy was 0·11–0·78 µmol m−2 s−1 at Jarú versus 0·22–1·19 µmol m−2 s−1 at Mbalmayo), and the mean Q10 for respiration at each site was 2·3 ± 0·9 (1 SD) and 2·0 ± 0·5 (1 SD), respectively. There were significant differences (P {\textless} 0·01) between sites in leaf phosphorus concentration, but not in leaf nitrogen concentration: Pm was very low at Jarú (0·2–0·7 mg g−1) but higher at Mbalmayo (0·5–2·4 mg g−1), whilst Nm was similar at both forests (10–45 mg g−1).3Rm was not significantly associated with canopy position or specific leaf area (SLA, m2 g−1) in either forest, but a significant relationship between SLA and Nm was found for both sites (P {\textless} 0·05), consistent with existing data. At Jarú, Rm was strongly related to Pm (P {\textless} 0·001) and less strongly related to Nm (P {\textless} 0·05), but at Mbalmayo, Rm was not significantly related to either Pm or Nm.4Ra was linearly related to Na and Pa at both sites (P {\textless} 0·01), principally because of changes in leaf mass per area (LMA, g m−2) associated with canopy position. At Mbalmayo, LMA explained 70\% of the variation in Ra, but only 20\% at Jarú. For Jarú, the strongest relationship with Ra was obtained by combining LMA with Pm in a multiple regression (r2 = 0·53); further inclusion of Nm did not improve the regression. At Mbalmayo neither Nm or Pm improved the regression of Ra on LMA.5These results indicate a strong influence of LMA on the relative rates of Ra within the vertical gradient of each canopy. They also suggest that at JarúPm constrains respiration more strongly than Nm, and further, that the very low Pm at Jarú may explain the lower absolute values of respiration there relative to Mbalmayo, where Pm was higher. The leaves at both sites are typical of lowland tropical rainforests in not having particularly low Nm, and consistent with this, Nm was a weaker predictor of respiration than Pm or LMA.},

The model consists of equations for the mean quantities and their vertical turbulent fluxes. Approximate equations for the triple correlations are incorporated to bypass the need to make parameterizations for the triple correlations based on gradient diffusion assumptions. A canopy radiative transfer model provides the necessary information to a leaf energy balance equation which partitions the net absorbed energy into sensible and latent heat emission rates. The model is shown to simulate the microenvironment of a stressed and non-stressed soybean canopy, with good agreement between modelled and measured mean temperature, specific humidity, net radiation and mean wind speed profiles. A comparison of the terms in the budget equations for the tangential stress, turbulent kinetic energy, and heat flux shows favorable agreement with results from recent wind tunnel studies.},

	abstract = {We identify three key issues to be taken into account when designing the next generation of software environments for agricultural modelling. There is a burgeoning need to support collaborative research in a search for answers to big research questions, to integrate the work of data providers and model developers and to provide more generic systems. We describe the concepts of software design of a framework, designed with these points in mind, which facilitates the integration of point-based agricultural models with methods to interpolate climate data. Our approach allows the inter-working of model and interpolation through Fortran functions that are invoked from a central framework. We advocate that the framework code remains open to collaborators, such that it may be adapted to different classes of application, whilst recognising that some module developers need to retain their control on individual elements of the software. The rationale presented within the paper continues a major move away from the stand-alone programs that still dominate agricultural models and interpolation methods. Secondly, the paper considers how these approaches are extendable to exploit opportunities in the emerging Web Service and Grid context. The emerging technology of the Grid allows geographically distributed resources in hardware, software, data and network to be co-ordinated to meet the needs of “virtual organisations.” We explore how the modularity of our existing code can be exploited in the Grid environment, whilst noting the pre-requisite of a co-operative culture in which both software developers and data providers seek to deliver services to the widest possible community of users.},

Against a backdrop of rapidly increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall, there is an urgent need to understand the influence of climate change on coffee production. Using a modelling approach in combination with remote sensing, supported by rigorous ground-truthing, we project changes in suitability for coffee farming under various climate change scenarios, specifically by assessing the exposure of coffee farming to future climatic shifts. We show that 39-59\% of the current growing area could experience climatic changes that are large enough to render them unsuitable for coffee farming, in the absence of significant interventions or major influencing factors. Conversely, relocation of coffee areas, in combination with forest conservation or re-establishment, could see at least a fourfold ({\textgreater}400\%) increase in suitable coffee farming area. We identify key coffee-growing areas that are susceptible to climate change, as well as those that are climatically resilient.},

We begin with the heat balance of dry-bulb and wet-bulb thermometers to establish basic principles and introduce the concept of resistances to heat and mass transfer. The heat balance of wet surfaces introduces adiabatic and diabatic processes. This leads to the Penman Equation, discussion of its application to estimating evaporation from natural surfaces, and analysis of the dependence of evaporation rate on the weather. Considering the heat balance of leaves, the Penman-Monteith (PM) Equation is developed, identifying the distinction between boundary layer resistances to heat and mass transfer and the stomatal resistance. Differences between factors influencing evaporation from wet surfaces and those influencing transpiration from leaves are discussed. The PM Equation is used to explore how transpiration and leaf temperature depend on radiation, humidity, windspeed, and stomatal resistance; rates of dew deposition are also discussed. Developments from the Penman and PM Equations conclude the chapter, including discussion of the “big-leaf model” for vegetation canopies, the equilibrium evaporation rate, and Priestley-Taylor coefficient, and the concept of “coupling” between vegetation and the atmosphere.},

It considers how the transport of entities such as heat, mass, and momentum is determined by the state of the atmosphere and the corresponding state of the surface involved in the exchange, whether soil, vegetation, the coat of an animal, or the integument of an insect or seed. A simple general equation can be derived for transport within a gas by “carriers”, which may be molecules, particles or eddies. A carrier can “unload” its excess of property P at a point where the local value is less than that at the starting point. This relation provides the “eddy covariance” method of measuring vertical fluxes. All three forms of transfer (heat, mass and momentum) are the direct consequence of molecular agitation, as they are described by similar relationships. Because the same process of molecular agitation is responsible for all the three types, the diffusion coefficients for momentum, heat, water vapor, and other gases are similar in size and in their dependence on temperature.},

Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists.

	abstract = {The first generation of forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments has successfully provided deeper understanding about how forests respond to an increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Located in aggrading stands in the temperate zone, they have provided a strong foundation for testing critical assumptions in terrestrial biosphere models that are being used to project future interactions between forest productivity and the atmosphere, despite the limited inference space of these experiments with regards to the range of global ecosystems. Now, a new generation of FACE experiments in mature forests in different biomes and over a wide range of climate space and biodiversity will significantly expand the inference space. These new experiments are: EucFACE in a mature Eucalyptus stand on highly weathered soil in subtropical Australia; AmazonFACE in a highly diverse, primary rainforest in Brazil; BIFoR-FACE in a 150-yr-old deciduous woodland stand in central England; and SwedFACE proposed in a hemiboreal, Pinus sylvestris stand in Sweden. We now have a unique opportunity to initiate a model–data interaction as an integral part of experimental design and to address a set of cross-site science questions on topics including responses of mature forests; interactions with temperature, water stress, and phosphorus limitation; and the influence of biodiversity.},

Whether or not the changes in soil nutrient status and stand structure will lead to mixtures that out-yield monocultures depends on the balance between positive interactions and the negative effects of interspecific competition, and on their effect on carbon (C) uptake and partitioning. We used a C budget approach to quantify growth, C uptake and C partitioning in monocultures of Eucalyptus grandis (W. Hill ex Maiden) and Acacia mangium (Willd.) (treatments E100 and A100, respectively), and in a mixture at the same stocking density with the two species at a proportion of 1 : 1 (treatment MS). Allometric relationships established over the whole rotation, and measurements of soil CO2 efflux and aboveground litterfall for ages 4–6 years after planting were used to estimate aboveground net primary production (ANPP), total belowground carbon flux (TBCF) and gross primary production (GPP). We tested the hypotheses that (i) species differences for wood production between E. grandis and A. mangium monocultures were partly explained by different C partitioning strategies, and (ii) the observed lower wood production in the mixture compared with eucalypt monoculture was mostly explained by a lower partitioning aboveground. At the end of the rotation, total aboveground biomass was lowest in A100 (10.5 kg DM m−2), intermediate in MS (12.2 kg DM m−2) and highest in E100 (13.9 kg DM m−2). The results did not support our first hypothesis of contrasting C partitioning strategies between E. grandis and A. mangium monocultures: the 21\% lower growth (ΔBw) in A100 compared with E100 was almost entirely explained by a 23\% lower GPP, with little or no species difference in ratios such as TBCF/GPP, ANPP/TBCF, ΔBw/ANPP and ΔBw/GPP. In contrast, the 28\% lower ΔBw in MS than in E100 was explained both by a 15\% lower GPP and by a 15\% lower fraction of GPP allocated to wood growth, thus partially supporting our second hypothesis: mixing the two species led to shifts in C allocations from above- to belowground, and from growth to litter production, for both species.},

Photosynthetic rate in mature leaves (p) was modeled as a rectangular hyperbolic function of photon flux density (q) and ambient CO2 concentration (ca), relative photosynthetic capacity (π) was modeled as a logistic s-function of leaf age (la), metabolic dark respiration rate (rm) was modeled as an exponential function of leaf temperature (Tl), and photorespiration rate (rp) was modeled as a hyperbolic function of ca. Assimilation rate (ac) was modeled as the difference between the product of p and π and the sum of rm and rp: ac = p(q,ca)π(la) – [rm(Tl) + rp(ca)]. The model parameters were estimated separately for five sources of E. poeppigiana (Clones 2660, 2662, 2687 and 2693 and half-sib Family 2431) from field data measured with a portable closed-loop gas exchange system at a humid tropical site in Costa Rica. The between-source differences in leaf CO2 exchange characteristics were small, but statistically significant. Aboveground biomass production was highest in sources that maintained high relative photosynthetic capacity throughout the leaf life span. Quantum yield varied between 0.046 and 0.067, and light-saturated assimilation rate (q = 2000 μmol m−2 s−1 and Tl = 28 °C) at natural atmospheric ca (350 μmol mol−1) was 16.8–19.9 μmol m−2 s−1. Increasing ca to 1000 μmol mol−1 resulted in an approximate doubling of the light-saturated assimilation rate. Foliole nitrogen concentration, which was 45.3–51.2 mg g−1 in mature leaves, was positively correlated with relative photosynthetic capacity. Foliole nitrogen concentration, quantum yield and maximum assimilation rate of E. poeppigiana are among the highest values observed in tropical woody legumes.},

As a starting point, specific objectives for climate change adaptation need to be articulated, which we consider to be synonymous with the criteria for conservation and sustainable management of boreal forests as defined by the Montréal Process. Secondly, because forest management plans are hierarchal — there are higher level strategic plans and lower level operational plans — it is important to distinguish at which planning level adaptation options are most appropriately considered. The purpose of this paper is to put forward a range of alternative adaptation options that forest managers working in the boreal zone could consider during the development of strategic and operational forest management plans in order to achieve sustainability as defined by the Montréal Process.},

Ultimately, insight into the hidden labile pools and the processes affecting the allocation of labile carbon to storage, maintenance and growth will improve our ability to predict tree growth, mortality and forest dynamics. We developed the 'Allometrically Constrained Growth and Carbon Allocation' (ACGCA) model that explicitly couples tree growth, mortality, allometries and labile carbon. This coupling results in (1) a semi-mechanistic basis for predicting tree death, (2) an allocation scheme that simultaneously satisfies allometric relationships and physiology-based carbon dynamics and (3) a range of physiological states that are consistent with tree behavior (e.g., healthy, static, shrinking, recovering, recovered and dead). We present the ACGCA model and illustrate aspects of its behavior by conducting simulations under different forest gap dynamics scenarios and with parameter values obtained for two ecologically dissimilar species: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.). The model reproduces growth and mortality patterns of these species that are consistent with their shade-tolerance and succession status. The ACGCA framework provides an alternative, and potentially improved, approach for predicting tree growth, mortality and forest dynamics.},

Multi-aged forest management systems represent a promising approach for increasing resistance and resilience, thereby limiting major disruptions to timber production and other ecosystem services. Multi-aged stands inherently have greater resistance and resilience to disturbances because of the presence of several age classes and more potential pathways for post-disturbance management and recovery. The preponderance of research also indicates few differences in productivity between multi-aged and even-aged management strategies. These factors combined suggest that increased adoption of multi-aged management systems will lead to a reduction in long-term risks. We advocate a disturbance integration management strategy that encourages managers to emulate disturbance effects with management, anticipate disturbances in planning, integrate the management of residual stand structures into salvage operations and build variable treatment intervals or cutting cycles into management regimes.},

The results suggest decreased areas suitable for Arabica coffee in Mesoamerica at lower altitudes. In South America close to the equator higher elevations could benefit, but higher latitudes lose suitability. Coffee regions in Ethiopia and Kenya are projected to become more suitable but those in India and Vietnam to become less suitable.

	title = {Can {CO2} fertilization compensate for progressive climate change impacts on coffee productivity? [{P67}]},
	abstract = {Different studies report negative impacts of climate change on coffee productivity using simple crop models. These models do not predict the effect of complex interactions between changing weather variables, like CO2, temperature and rainfall, and their consequences on plant physiology. In this study, a coffee agroforestry process based model (CAF2007) was used to integrate processes and mechanisms that determine climate change effects on coffee. The model was calibrated using data of 11 experimental plots in different agro-climatic and managements conditions, using Bayesian calibration methods. We validated the model in commercial coffee plantations and finally used it to estimate climate change impacts and simulated shade tree management to explore adaptation options. Bayesian calibration greatly improved the performances of the model. The RMSE were generally lower when calibrating independently on the 11 experiments, but the agreement was still good when the calibration was made in all experiments within one climatic zone, or even globally using all 11 datasets. The model calibrated globally was more robust. It performed adequately when using data from commercial farms located in all four climatic regions that form the coffee producing regions of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Annual average precipitation changes (predictions from RCP8.5 emission scenario and downscaled MIROC5 GCM) affect coffee yields both positively and negatively depending on site conditions and magnitude of change; temperature increases affect coffee yield negatively. However impacts depend on shade tree density and species. CO2 fertilization affects coffee positively, and can compensate for negative effects of temperature and precipitation changes. Shade from densely planted timber trees was more effective than heavily managed shade from Erythrina poeppigiana in mitigating the negative effects of temperature increase on coffee. We discussed other adaptation strategies to adapt coffee agroforesty systems to climate change, as well as increase their CO2 sequestration. (Texte intégral)},

	abstract = {For three forest canopies (a sparse, boreal needleleaf; a temperate broadleaf; and a dense, tropical, broadleaf stand) light-use efficiency (LUE) is found to be 6–33\% higher when sky radiance is dominated by diffuse rather than direct sunlight. This enhancement is much less than that reported previously for both crops (110\%; Choudbury, 2001) and moderately dense temperate woodland (50–180\%). We use the land-surface scheme JULES to interpret the observed canopy response. Once sunflecks and leaf orientation are incorporated explicitly into the scheme, our simulations reproduce convincingly the overall level of canopy gross photosynthetic product (GPP), its enhancement with respect to diffuse sunlight and the mean 15\% reduction in productivity observed during the afternoon due to stomatal closure. The LUE enhancement under diffuse sunlight can be explained by sharing of the canopy radiation-load, which is reduced under direct sky radiance. Once sunflecks are accounted for the advantage of implementing more sophisticated calculations of stomatal conductance (e.g. Ball–Berry and SPA submodels) is less obvious even for afternoon assimilation. Empirical relations are developed between observed carbon flux and the environmental variables total downwelling shortwave radiation (SW), canopy temperature (T) and the fraction of diffuse sky radiance (fDIF). These relations allow us to gauge the impact of increased/reduced insolation on GPP and net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Overall the three stands appear to be fairly stable within global trends and typical interannual variability (SW changing by {\textless}15\%). Greatest sensitivity is exhibited by the boreal site, Zotino, where NEE falls by 9±4\% for a 15\% reduction in SW.},

We compared two different modelling approaches, the MOTTI-YASSO and the EFIMOD-ROMUL model combinations, with respect to the simulated impacts of the biomass extraction in final felling on subsequent biomass and soil carbon stocks. Simulations following the latest silvicultural recommendations over a rotation were made for six Finnish forest sites varying in fertility, tree species and latitude. Model-projected effect of the intensified biomass extraction was larger with EFIMOD-ROMUL than with MOTTI-YASSO. The soil model ROMUL projected slower decomposition of organic matter than YASSO at all studied sites, which made the effect of biomass extraction on soil larger with EFIMOD. The process-based model EFIMOD-ROMUL includes feedback from soil nutrient status to productivity. With EFIMOD-ROMUL, the intensified biomass extraction decreased slightly the simulated growth of the forests and thereby the biomass carbon stock and litter input to the soil. With the empirical MOTTI model, the intensity of the simulated biomass extraction did not affect forest growth. Our results underline the importance of the selection of the modelling approach when projecting the potential effects of forest management practises on forest carbon balance.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Enhancement of light harvesting in annual crops has successfully led to yield increases since the green revolution. Such an improvement has mainly been achieved by selecting plants with optimal canopy architecture for specific agronomic practices. For perennials such as oil palm, breeding programmes were focused more on fruit yield, but now aim at exploring more complex traits. The aim of the present study is to investigate potential improvements in light interception and carbon assimilation in the study case of oil palm, by manipulating leaf traits and proposing architectural ideotypes. Methods: Sensitivity analyses (Morris method and metamodel) were performed on a functional–structural plant model recently developed for oil palm which takes into account genetic variability, in order to virtually assess the impact of plant architecture on light interception efficiency and potential carbon acquisition. Key Results: The most sensitive parameters found over plant development were those related to leaf area (rachis length, number of leaflets, leaflet morphology), although fine attributes related to leaf geometry showed increasing influence when the canopy became closed. In adult stands, optimized carbon assimilation was estimated on plants with a leaf area index between 3.2 and 5.5 m2 m−2 (corresponding to usual agronomic conditions), with erect leaves, short rachis and petiole, and high number of leaflets on the rachis. Four architectural ideotypes for carbon assimilation are proposed based on specific combinations of organ dimensions and arrangement that limit mutual shading and optimize light distribution within the plant crown. Conclusions: A rapid set-up of leaf area is critical at young age to optimize light interception and subsequently carbon acquisition. At the adult stage, optimization of carbon assimilation could be achieved through specific combinations of architectural traits. The proposition of multiple morphotypes with comparable level of carbon assimilation opens the way to further investigate ideotypes carrying an optimal trade-off between carbon assimilation, plant transpiration and biomass partitioning.},

	abstract = {Tropical forest responses to climatic variability have important consequences for global carbon cycling, but are poorly understood. As empirical, correlative studies cannot disentangle the interactive effects of climatic variables on tree growth, we used a tree growth model (IBTREE) to unravel the climate effects on different physiological pathways and in turn on stem growth variation. We parameterized the model for canopy trees of Toona ciliata (Meliaceae) from a Thai monsoon forest and compared predicted and measured variation from a tree-ring study over a 30-year period. We used historical climatic variation of minimum and maximum day temperature, precipitation and carbon dioxide (CO2) in different combinations to estimate the contribution of each climate factor in explaining the inter-annual variation in stem growth. Running the model with only variation in maximum temperature and rainfall yielded stem growth patterns that explained almost 70\% of the observed inter-annual variation in stem growth. Our results show that maximum temperature had a strong negative effect on the stem growth by increasing respiration, reducing stomatal conductance and thus mitigating a higher transpiration demand, and – to a lesser extent – by directly reducing photosynthesis. Although stem growth was rather weakly sensitive to rain, stem growth variation responded strongly and positively to rainfall variation owing to the strong inter-annual fluctuations in rainfall. Minimum temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration did not significantly contribute to explaining the inter-annual variation in stem growth. Our innovative approach – combining a simulation model with historical data on tree-ring growth and climate – allowed disentangling the effects of strongly correlated climate variables on growth through different physiological pathways. Similar studies on different species and in different forest types are needed to further improve our understanding of the sensitivity of tropical tree growth to climatic variability and change.},

Over the crop years 2004/2005 and 2006/2007, from 150 days after flowering (DAF) onwards, samples of 50 fruits of cultivars Mundo Novo IAC 376–4, Obatã IAC 1669–20 and Catuaí Vermelho IAC 144 were collected from coffee trees located in Campinas, Brazil. The endosperm of the fruits was freeze-dried, ground and analyzed for sucrose content by high-performance liquid chromatography. A weather station provided data to calculate the accumulated growing degree-day (GDD) units, and the reference (ETo) and actual (ETr) evapotranspiration rates. The results showed that the highest rates of sucrose accumulation occurred at the transition from the cane-green to the cherry phenological stage. Models for the estimation of sucrose content during maturation based on meteorological variables exhibited similar or better performance than the DAF variable, with better results for the variables GDD and ETo. The Mundo Novo cultivar reached the highest sucrose level in the endosperm after 2,790 GDD, while cultivar Catuaí attained its maximum sucrose concentration after the accumulated evapotranspiration rate has reached a value of 870 mm. As for cultivar Obatã, the maximum sucrose concentration was predicted with the same degree of accuracy using any of the parameters investigated. For the Obatã cultivar, the values of the variables calculated for the maximum sucrose concentration to be reached were 249 DAF, 3,090 GDD, 1,020 ETo and 900 ETr.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) and its partitioning into transpiration and evaporation is fundamental for improving water management practices in water-limited environments and under deficit irrigation conditions. This investigation was conducted to estimate the water balance and ET components of subsurface drip (SDI) irrigated Chardonnay wine grapes for two seasons (2010–2011 and 2011–2012) using a numerical model (HYDRUS-2D). Treatments involved the application of different volumes [51\% (I1), 64\% (I2), 77\% (I3), and 92\% (I4) of normal application] of water for irrigation. A modified version of the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach was used to generate daily transpiration and evaporation as inputs to the HYDRUS-2D model. The calibrated and validated model produced estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ETCact), actual transpiration (Tpact), and actual evaporation (Esact), and deep percolation under varied irrigation applications. The model-simulated values were then used to estimate actual crop coefficients (Kcact and Kcbact), and water productivity of wine grape under different deficit irrigation conditions. Seasonal ETCact simulated by HYDRUS-2D for different treatments varied between 239 and 382 mm. However, seasonal evaporation accounted for 44–59\% of seasonal ETCact losses in different treatments. The modelled daily transpiration rate in I4 treatment (Tp4act) varied from 0.11–2.74 mm/day. Deep percolation accounted for 35–40\% of the total water applied by rainfall and irrigation. The mean value of actual crop coefficient (Kcact) estimated by HYDRUS-2D simulated ETC act over the two seasons was 0.27, which matched with other investigations. Similarly, values of Kcbact for initial, mid and end stages were 0.13, 0.27 and 0.14, respectively. Monthly values of evaporation coefficient (Ke) ranged from 0.1 to 0.32, with a mean value of 0.18. Water productivity with respect to ET losses (WPETC) ranged from 5.9 to 6.2 kg/m3 of water use. However, water productivity for transpiration (WPTC) almost doubled as compared to WPETC in all treatments. The impact of deficit irrigation on berry juice composition (Brix, pH and titratable acidity) was lower than the inter-seasonal variability. These results can help develop better irrigation management strategies for SDI irrigated wine grapes under water scarce conditions.},

These errors are due to radiative heat exchange with the environment and to convective heat exchange with the ambient air. The magnitude of the error depends on the relevant temperature differences and on the resistance to heat transport between the object and the junction. The irreproducibility of this resistance causes the large variability in the measured temperatures. Measurement errors up to 7°C or to 30\% of the temperature difference between object and environment are found with thermocouples of 0.1 mm diameter. The radiation and convection error can be minimized by a reduction of the wire diameter and a careful positioning of the junction against the leaf surface with a slight pressure permanently exerted on it.},

Concluding remarks Acknowledgements References Appendix A1 SUMMARY: By means of meta-analyses we determined how 70 traits related to plant anatomy, morphology, chemistry, physiology, growth and reproduction are affected by daily light integral (DLI; mol photons m(-2) d(-1) ). A large database including 500 experiments with 760 plant species enabled us to determine generalized dose-response curves. Many traits increase with DLI in a saturating fashion. Some showed a more than 10-fold increase over the DLI range of 1-50 mol m(-2) d(-1) , such as the number of seeds produced per plant and the actual rate of photosynthesis. Strong decreases with DLI (up to three-fold) were observed for leaf area ratio and leaf payback time. Plasticity differences among species groups were generally small compared with the overall responses to DLI. However, for a number of traits, including photosynthetic capacity and realized growth, we found woody and shade-tolerant species to have lower plasticity. We further conclude that the direction and degree of trait changes adheres with responses to plant density and to vertical light gradients within plant canopies. This synthesis provides a strong quantitative basis for understanding plant acclimation to light, from molecular to whole plant responses, but also identifies the variables that currently form weak spots in our knowledge, such as respiration and reproductive characteristics.},

	doi = {10.1093/jxb/erj002},
	abstract = {The effect of irradiance on leaf construction costs, chemical composition, and on the payback time of leaves was investigated. To enable more generalized conclusions, three different systems were studied: top and the most-shaded leaves of 10 adult tree species in a European mixed forest, top leaves of sub-dominant trees of two evergreen species growing in small gaps or below the canopy in an Amazonian rainforest, and plants of six herbaceous and four woody species grown hydroponically at low or high irradiance in growth cabinets. Daily photon irradiance varied 3–6-fold between low- and high-light leaves. Specific leaf area (SLA) was 30–130\% higher at low light. Construction costs, on the other hand, were 1–5\% lower for low-irradiance leaves, mainly because low-irradiance leaves had lower concentrations of soluble phenolics. Photosynthetic capacity and respiration, expressed per unit leaf mass, were hardly different for the low- and high-light leaves. Estimates of payback times of the high-irradiance leaves ranged from 2–4 d in the growth cabinets, to 15–20 d for the adult tree species in the European forest. Low-irradiance leaves had payback times that were 2–3 times larger, ranging from 4 d in the growth cabinets to 20–80 d at the most shaded part of the canopy of the mixed forest. In all cases, estimated payback times were less than half the life span of the leaves, suggesting that even at time-integrated irradiances lower than 5\% of the total seasonal value, investment in leaves is still fruitful from a carbon-economy point of view. A sensitivity analysis showed that increased SLA of low-irradiance leaves was the main factor constraining payback times. Acclimation in the other five factors determining payback time, namely construction costs, photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf mass, respiration per unit leaf mass, apparent quantum yield, and curvature of the photosynthetic light-response-curve, were unimportant when the observed variation in each factor was examined.},

Arabica genotypes generally produce a higher coffee quality than Robusta genotypes. Understanding the genetic basis for sucrose accumulation during coffee grain maturation is an important goal because sucrose is an important coffee flavor precursor. * Nine new Coffea genes encoding sucrose metabolism enzymes have been identified: sucrose phosphate synthase (CcSPS1, CcSPS2), sucrose phosphate phosphatase (CcSP1), cytoplasmic (CaInv3) and cell wall (CcInv4) invertases and four invertase inhibitors (CcInvI1, 2, 3, 4). * Activities and mRNA abundance of the sucrose metabolism enzymes were compared at different developmental stages in Arabica and Robusta grains, characterized by different sucrose contents in mature grain. * It is concluded that Robusta accumulates less sucrose than Arabica for two reasons: Robusta has higher sucrose synthase and acid invertase activities early in grain development - the expression of CcSS1 and CcInv2 appears to be crucial at this stage and Robusta has a lower SPS activity and low CcSPS1 expression at the final stages of grain development and hence has less capacity for sucrose re-synthesis.

	abstract = {The response of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) agronomical performance to changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) is uncertain. Improving our understanding of potential responses of the coffee plant to these changes while taking into consideration agricultural management is required for identifying best-bet adaptation strategies. A mechanistic crop modelling approach enables the inclusion of a wide range of prior knowledge and an evaluation of assumptions. We adapt a model by connecting it to spatially variable soil and climate data, by which we are able to calculate yield of rain-fed coffee on a daily time-step. The model takes account of variation in microclimate and water use as influenced by shade trees. The approach is exemplified at two East African sites with distinctly different climates (Mt. Elgon, Uganda, and Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania) using a global sensitivity analysis for evaluation of model behavior and prior parameter uncertainty assessment. We use the climate scenario driven by the Hadley Global Environment Model 2-Earth System representative for the year 2050 to discuss potential responses of the coffee plant to interactions of elevated [CO2], temperature, and water availability. We subsequently explore the potential for adaptation to this scenario through shade management. The results indicate that under current climatic conditions optimal shade cover at low elevations (1000 m.a.s.l.) is 50\%, provided soil water storage capacity is sufficient, enabling a 13.5\% increase in coffee yield compared to unshaded systems. Coffee plants are expected to be severely impacted (ranging from 18\% to 32\% coffee yield reductions) at low elevations by increased temperature (+2.5 °C) and drought stress when no elevated [CO2] is assumed. Water competition between coffee and shade trees are projected to be a severe limitation in the future, requiring careful selection of appropriate shade tree species or the adoption of other technologies like conservation measures or irrigation. The [CO2]-fertilization effect could potentially mitigate the negative effect of temperature increase and drought stress up to 13–21\% depending on site conditions and will increase yield at higher altitudes. High uncertainty remains regarding impacts of climate change on flowering. The presented model allows for estimating the optimal shade level along environmental gradients now and in the future. Overall, it shows that shade proves to be an important adaptation strategy, but this requires improved understanding regarding site-specific management and selection of tree species. Moreover, we do not yet include climate change uncertainty.},

It evaluates further the sensitivity of croplands to any possible changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Location The location is global, geographically explicit. Methods The methods used are spatial data synthesis and analysis and numerical modelling. Results There is a cropland ‘reserve’ of 120\%, mainly in tropical South America and Africa. Our climate sensitivity analysis indicates that the southern provinces of Canada, north-western and north-central states of the United States, northern Europe, southern Former Soviet Union and the Manchurian plains of China are most sensitive to changes in temperature. The Great Plains region of the United States and north-eastern China are most sensitive to changes in precipitation. The regions that are sensitive to precipitation change are also sensitive to changes in CO2, but the magnitude is small compared to the influence of direct climate change. We estimate that climate change, as simulated by global climate models, will expand cropland suitability by an additional 16\%, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes. However, the tropics (mainly Africa, northern South America, Mexico and Central America and Oceania) will experience a small decrease in suitability due to climate change. Main conclusions There is a large reserve of cultivable croplands, mainly in tropical South America and Africa. However, much of this land is under valuable forests or in protected areas. Furthermore, the tropical soils could potentially lose fertility very rapidly once the forest cover is removed. Regions that lie at the margins of temperature or precipitation limitation to cultivation are most sensitive to changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration. It is anticipated that climate change will result in an increase in cropland suitability in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes (mainly in developed nations), while the tropics will lose suitability (mainly in developing nations).},

	abstract = {AbstractThis paper addresses several hypotheses designed to explain why AOGCM simulations of future climate in the third phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) feature an intensified reduction of precipitation over the Meso-America (MA) region. While the drying is consistent with an amplification of the subtropical high pressure cells and an equatorward contraction of convective regions due to the “upped ante” for convection in a warmer atmosphere, the physical mechanisms behind the intensity and robustness of the MA drying signal have not been fully explored. Regional variations in sea surface temperature (SST) warming may play a role. First, SSTs over the tropical North Atlantic (TNA) do not warm as much as the surrounding ocean. The troposphere senses a TNA that is cooler than the tropical Pacific, potentially exciting a Gill-type response, increasing the strength of the North Atlantic subtropical high. Second, the warm ENSO-like state simulated in the eastern tropical Pacific could decrease precipitation over MA, as warm ENSO events are associated with drying over MA.The authors use the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) AGCM to investigate the effects of these regional SST warming variations on the projected drying over MA. First, the change of SSTs [Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B’s Twentieth-Century Climate in Coupled Model (A1B-20C)] in the ensemble average of the CMIP3 models is applied to determine if the ICTP AGCM can replicate the future drying. Then the effects of 1) removing the reduced warming over the TNA, 2) removing the warm ENSO-event-like pattern in the eastern tropical Pacific, and 3) applying uniform SST warming throughout the tropics are tested. The ICTP AGCM can reproduce the general pattern and amount of precipitation over MA. Simulations in which the CMIP3 A1B-20C ensemble-average SSTs are added to climatological SSTs show drying of more than 20\% over the MA region, similar to the CMIP3 ensemble average. Replacing the relatively cooler SSTs over the TNA excites a Gill response consistent with an off-equatorial heating anomaly, showing that the TNA relative cooling is responsible for about 16\% (31\%) of the drying in late spring (early summer). The warm ENSO-like SST pattern over the eastern Pacific also affects precipitation over the MA region, with changes of 19\% and 31\% in March–June (MMJ) and June–August (JJA), respectively. This work highlights the importance of understanding even robust signals in the CMIP3 future scenario simulations, and should aid in the design and analysis of future climate change studies over the region.},

A wide variety of methods and tools have been introduced for surrogate modeling aiming to develop and utilize computationally more efficient surrogates of high-fidelity models mostly in optimization frameworks. This paper reviews, analyzes, and categorizes research efforts on surrogate modeling and applications with an emphasis on the research accomplished in the water resources field. The review analyzes 48 references on surrogate modeling arising from water resources and also screens out more than 100 references from the broader research community. Two broad families of surrogates namely response surface surrogates, which are statistical or empirical data-driven models emulating the high-fidelity model responses, and lower-fidelity physically based surrogates, which are simplified models of the original system, are detailed in this paper. Taxonomies on surrogate modeling frameworks, practical details, advances, challenges, and limitations are outlined. Important observations and some guidance for surrogate modeling decisions are provided along with a list of important future research directions that would benefit the common sampling and search (optimization) analyses found in water resources.},

In particular, the general consequences of heat and drought on (1) photosynthesis and respiration at the cellular and community level, and (2) on nutrient uptake, partitioning and competition for nutrients are summarized. The latter are a major sink for photosynthetic energy and, therefore, are indirectly but strongly connected to the performance of photosynthesis. In addition, the interaction of heat and drought with stress compensation mechanisms and emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) are discussed, since these processes are directly connected to carbon metabolism. Effects on the emission of BVOC are also included because they constitute an important feedback mechanism on ozone formation and, thus, on atmospheric pollution. As far as available, data collected during the 2003 heat wave are included and discussed.},

In this study we assessed the periods of resource limitation for vegetative (current year stems, and woody biomass) and reproductive (fruit) organs of a major agricultural crop: the apple tree. This was done by comparing relative growth rates of individual organs in trees with reduced competition for resources to trees grown under standard field conditions. Special attention was dedicated to disentangling patterns and values of maximum potential growth for each organ type. The period of resource limitation for vegetative growth was much longer than in another fruit tree species (peach): from late May until harvest. Two periods of resource limitation were highlighted for fruit: from the beginning of the season until mid-June, and about one month prior to harvest. By investigating the variability in individual organs growth we identified substantial differences in relative growth rates among different shoot categories (proleptic and epicormic) and within each group of monitored organs. Qualitatively different and more accurate values of growth rates for vegetative organs, compared to the use of the simple compartmental means, were estimated. Detailed, source-sink based tree growth models, commonly in need of fine parameter tuning, are expected to benefit from the results produced by these analyses.},

	doi = {10.1101/370189 %J bioRxiv},
	abstract = {Background and aims: Carbon allocation in plants is usually represented at a specific spatial scale, peculiar to each model. This makes the results obtained by different models, and the impact of their scale of representation, difficult to compare. In this work we developed a Multi Scale Carbon Allocation model (MuSCA) that can be applied at different, user-defined, topological scales of a plant, and used to assess the impact of each spatial scale on simulated results and computation time. Methods: Model multi-scale consistency and behavior were tested by applications on three realistic apple tree structures. Carbon allocation was computed at five spatial scales, spanning from the metamer (the finest scale, used as a reference) up to 1st order branches, and for different values of a sap friction coefficient. Fruit dry mass increments were compared across spatial scales and with field data. Key Results: The model showed physiological coherence in representing competition for carbon assimilates. Results from intermediate values of the friction parameter best fitted the field data. For these, fruit growth simulated at the metamer scale (considered as a reference) differed from about 1\% at growth unit scale up to 35\% at first order branch scale. Generally, the coarser the spatial scale the more fruit growth diverged from the reference and the lower the obtained within-tree fruit growth variability. Coherence in the carbon allocated across scales was also differently impacted, depending on the tree structure considered. Decreasing the topological resolution reduced computation time up to four orders of magnitude. Conclusions: MuSCA revealed that the topological scale has a major influence on the simulation of carbon allocation, suggesting that this factor should be carefully evaluated when using different carbon allocation models or comparing their results. Trades-off between computation time and prediction accuracy can be evaluated by changing topological scales.},

	volume = {71},
	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Understanding leaf temperature (T$_{\textrm{leaf}}$) variation in the canopy of tropical forests is critical for accurately calculating net primary productivity because plant respiration and net photosynthesis are highly sensitive to temperature. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the spatiotemporal variation of T$_{\textrm{leaf}}$ \textit{{\textless}/i{\textgreater}in a semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panama and (2) create a season-specific empirical model to predict T$_{\textrm{leaf}}$ {\textless}i{\textgreater}}in the canopy. To achieve this, we used a 42 m tall construction crane for canopy access and monitored the microenvironment within the canopy of mature, 20-35 m tall trees of 5 tropical tree species during the wet and the dry season. T$_{\textrm{leaf}}$ \textit{{\textless}/i{\textgreater}was correlated to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the wet season but not in the dry season, possibly due to seasonal differences in wind speed, physiology, and canopy phenology. A structural equation model showed that T$_{\textrm{leaf}}$ {\textless}i{\textgreater}}is best explained by air temperature (T$_{\textrm{air}}$) and PPFD in the wet season, whereas in the dry season, T$_{\textrm{air}}$ \textit{{\textless}/i{\textgreater}alone predicted most of the variation in T$_{\textrm{leaf}}$. These results suggest the utility of an empirical approach to estimate T$_{\textrm{leaf}}$ {\textless}i{\textgreater}}variability where simple meteorological data are available. This approach can be incorporated in future models of vegetation-atmosphere carbon and water exchange models of mature tropical forests with similar seasonality.},

Therefore, this work aims to link the physiological and biochemical responses of photosynthesis to elevated air [CO2 ] and temperature in cultivated genotypes of Coffea arabica L. (cv. Icatu and IPR108) and Coffea canephora cv. Conilon CL153. Plants were grown for ca. 10 months at 25/20 degrees C (day/night) and 380 or 700 mul CO2 l(-1) and then subjected to temperature increase (0.5 degrees C day(-1) ) to 42/34 degrees C. Leaf impacts related to stomatal traits, gas exchanges, C isotope composition, fluorescence parameters, thylakoid electron transport and enzyme activities were assessed at 25/20, 31/25, 37/30 and 42/34 degrees C. The results showed that (1) both species were remarkably heat tolerant up to 37/30 degrees C, but at 42/34 degrees C a threshold for irreversible nonstomatal deleterious effects was reached. Impairments were greater in C. arabica (especially in Icatu) and under normal [CO2 ]. Photosystems and thylakoid electron transport were shown to be quite heat tolerant, contrasting to the enzymes related to energy metabolism, including RuBisCO, which were the most sensitive components. (2) Significant stomatal trait modifications were promoted almost exclusively by temperature and were species dependent. Elevated [CO2 ], (3) strongly mitigated the impact of temperature on both species, particularly at 42/34 degrees C, modifying the response to supra-optimal temperatures, (4) promoted higher water-use efficiency under moderately higher temperature (31/25 degrees C) and (5) did not provoke photosynthetic downregulation. Instead, enhancements in [CO2 ] strengthened photosynthetic photochemical efficiency, energy use and biochemical functioning at all temperatures. Our novel findings demonstrate a relevant heat resilience of coffee species and that elevated [CO2 ] remarkably mitigated the impact of heat on coffee physiology, therefore playing a key role in this crop sustainability under future climate change scenarios.},

A previous simulation model of the coffee plant was developed using data from Brazil where coffee phenology is characterized by distinct seasonal flowering (Gutierrez et al., 1998). In contrast, flowering in Colombia is continuous with low seasonality. To capture the differences in coffee phenology and growth in the two climatic regions, the Gutierrez et al. (1998) model was modified using new data from Colombia.The modifications to the model include:(1)The effect of solar radiation on floral buds initiation;(2)An age structure population model to track the daily input and development of the floral buds;(3)The effect of leaf water potential on breaking dormancy in flower buds, and hence on the timing and intensity of flowering;(4)The incorporation of both the vegetative and the reproductive demands to predict the photosynthetic rate.(5)The effect of low temperature on photosynthesis and defoliation.Other aspects of the model were re-interpreted and refinements made to generalize its structure for use across coffee varieties and geographic areas. The model, without modification, realistically simulates field data from Brazil and two Colombian locations having different varieties, patterns of rainfall and hence flowering phenology.The model will be used as the base trophic level for incorporating CBB and high tropic levels effects, and for the analysis of management options in the coffee production system.},

	title = {Eight years studying ecosystem services in a coffee agroforestry observatory. {Practical} applications for the stakeholders},
	abstract = {Eight years of monitoring ecophysiology and ecosystem services (ES) in a large coffee farm of Costa Rica yields a range of practical applications for the farmer and stakeholders, thanks to numerous scientific actors and disciplines contributing to our collaborative observatory (Coffee-Flux). ¿ A lot of ecosystem services depend on the soil properties, such as runoff/infiltration, water and nutrient storage capacity. It is essential to relate hydrological and soil conservation services to the soil type, since this might have even more importance than the crop itself for ES. Regarding the use of fertilizer, we show that some soils may have a large storage capacity, allowing producing coffee at normal yields with just a reduced, or even a minimum amount of fertilizers, for instance when the economic conditions are unfavorable. Also, due to the soil variability within the farm, it is possible to adjust fertilization to micro-local conditions and reduce the total expenses and risks of leaching of N to the environment. VNIRS and MIR are promising broadband tools for screening the variability in soils. Adjusting N fertilizer to the optimum will also considerably reduce the N2O emissions and improve the GHG balance of the farm. ¿ Pesticides-fongicides: we show that an adequate amount of shade trees allows reducing the severity of the whole complex of leaf diseases. This also should reduce expenses and impacts on the ecosystem. ¿ Roots: a simple survey of basal area at collar allows estimating the belowground biomass and the average age of a plantation, to judge of its market value and to decide when to replace it. ¿ Also starch plays a key role in the trophic equilibrium between the perennial parts of the coffee plant (aerial stump, belowground stump, coarse roots) and its ephemeral parts (resprout, leaves, fruits, fine roots). Coffee plants accumulate starch in the stumps by the end of the life of their resprout, as a strategy for survival. Breeding plants with less starch build-up capacity would probably allow increasing the fraction of productive years during the lifespan of the resprouts. ¿ Coffee farms are probably much closer to C neutrality than currently admitted using the C-Neutrality protocol. We stress the prevailing role of coffee plants + litter + soil in the ecosystem C balance. If those are excluded from the calculations as done so far, coffee farms are GHG sources, by definition. We argue that either full assessments (as proposed here, at the ecosystem level, including trees, coffee, litter, soil and roots) or consensus on ¿sequestration factors¿ (the counterpart of emission factors) would allow performing a more realistic assessment of the GHG balance. ¿ Finally, we bring new data confirming that shade trees offer numerous ecosystem services, when adequately managed for the local context. As compared to full sun conditions, they may (i) reduce laminar erosion by a factor of ca. 2, (ii) increase the atmospheric N2 fixation and the \% of N recycled into the system, thus reducing the fertilizer requirements, (iii) reduce the severity of the leaf disease complex, (iv) increase C sequestration, (v) improve the microclimate, and (vi) be a large part of the solution to face climate changes.

	abstract = {Numerous studies conducted on both whole plants and isolated epidermes have documented stomatal sensitivity to CO2. In general, CO2 concentrations below ambient stimulate stomatal opening, or an inhibition of stomatal closure, while CO2 concentrations above ambient have the opposite effect. The rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations which has occurred since the industrial revolution, and which is predicted to continue, will therefore alter rates of transpirational water loss and CO2 uptake in terrestrial plants. An understanding of the cellular basis for guard cell CO2 sensing could allow us to better predict, and perhaps ultimately to manipulate, such vegetation responses to climate change. However, the mechanisms by which guard cells sense and respond to the CO2 signal remain unknown. It has been hypothesized that cytosolic pH and malate levels, cytosolic Ca2+ levels, chloroplastic zeaxanthin levels, or plasma-membrane anion channel regulation by apoplastic malate are involved in guard cell perception and response to CO2. In this review, these hypotheses are discussed, and the evidence for guard cell acclimation to prevailing CO2 concentrations is also considered.},

	abstract = {Abstract Eddy covariance flux observations at a deciduous temperate forest site (83 days) and at a boreal forest site (21 days) are analyzed for midday periods (1100–1400 LT). Approximate stationarity of the time series is demonstrated, and the ensemble-averaged roughness sublayer cospectra are presented. Spectral and cospectral forms in the roughness sublayer are more peaked than those found in an inertial sublayer. They exhibit similar forms dependent on (z − d)/(h − d), where d is the displacement height and h is the canopy height. The inertial-layer spectral forms are recovered when observations are made where this scaled height is approximately 4. For a sample summer at the midlatitude deciduous forest, large eddies with periods from 4 to 30 min contribute about 17\% to surface eddy fluxes of heat, water vapor, and carbon dioxide (CO2). Much larger contributions can occur in light-wind conditions. This effect, likely caused by the passage of convective boundary layer eddies, is not observed when using many currently popular averaging procedures. Several running-mean periods have been used to assess the effect of the mean removal procedure on flux estimates. Given the assumption that large eddies would have been sampled at the towers had an ensemble measurement been possible, a correction is proposed based primarily on the mean wind speed to adjust fluxes obtained using short averaging intervals. This correction is successful in achieving observational energy-balance closure at two dissimilar forested sites. Cospectral similarity is found for all scalars studied. Daytime fluxes of CO2, for example, can be underestimated at standard flux towers by 10\%–40\%, depending on wind speed.},

	abstract = {Research on the degree to which carbon (C) availability limits growth in trees, as well as recent trends in climate change and concurrent increases in drought-related tree mortality, have led to a renewed focus on the physiological mechanisms associated with tree growth responses to current and future climate. This has led to some dispute over the role of stored non-structural C compounds as indicators of a tree's current demands for photosynthate. Much of the uncertainty surrounding this issue could be resolved by developing a better understanding of the potential functions of non-structural C stored within trees. In addition to functioning as a buffer to reconcile temporal asynchrony between C demand and supply, the storage of non-structural C compounds may be under greater regulation than commonly recognized. We propose that in the face of environmental stochasticity, large, long-lived trees may require larger C investments in storage pools as safety margins than previously recognized, and that an important function of these pools may be to maintain hydraulic transport, particularly during episodes of severe stress. If so, survival and long-term growth in trees remain a function of C availability. Given that drought, freeze-thaw events and increasing tree height all impose additional constraints on vascular transport, the common trend of an increase in non-structural carbohydrate concentrations with tree size, drought or cold is consistent with our hypothesis. If the regulated maintenance of relatively large constitutive stored C pools in trees serves to maintain hydraulic integrity, then the minimum thresholds are expected to vary depending on the specific tissues, species, environment, growth form and habit. Much research is needed to elucidate the extent to which allocation of C to storage in trees is a passive vs. an active process, the specific functions of stored C pools, and the factors that drive active C allocation to storage.},

Light extinction coefficients were estimated for 19 stands of varying age and structure from measured light interception using the Beer-Lambert equation. Estimates of G (k corrected for solar angle) varied between 0.28 and 0.70 and were negatively correlated with estimates of leaf area index (LAI) and the percent gap in the canopy. We also simulated the effects of changing canopy architecture on light penetration. Simulation results suggested that the order of importance of the characteristics of canopy architecture on light penetration was: (1) LAI; (2) foliage aggregation; (3) average leaf inclination angle; (4) vertical distribution of foliage. Direct measurement and simulation of light penetration suggested that increased LAI and increased within-crown foliage aggregation result in a reduced light capture efficiency (light capture/unit LAI). Canopy gaps tend to be more pronounced in dense, older lodgepole pine forests. High LAI and aggregated foliage distributions associated with this forest structure would cause increased foliage overlap and foliage self shading, thus reducing light capture efficiency.},

Under climate change, with more frequent stresses and novel shocks, 'climate adaptation services', are defined as the benefits to people from increased social ability to respond to change, provided by the capability of ecosystems to moderate and adapt to climate change and variability. They broaden the ecosystem services framework to assist decision makers in planning for an uncertain future with new choices and options. We present a generic framework for operationalising the adaptation services concept. Four steps guide the identification of intrinsic ecological mechanisms that facilitate the maintenance and emergence of ecosystem services during periods of change, and so materialise as adaptation services. We applied this framework for four contrasted Australian ecosystems. Comparative analyses enabled by the operational framework suggest that adaptation services that emerge during trajectories of ecological change are supported by common mechanisms: vegetation structural diversity, the role of keystone species or functional groups, response diversity and landscape connectivity, which underpin the persistence of function and the reassembly of ecological communities under severe climate change and variability. Such understanding should guide ecosystem management towards adaptation planning.},

We assessed productivity through coffee yield and coffee morphological characteristics. IC had the highest productivity but had the highest yield bienniality; in the agroforestry systems productivity was similar for moderate conventional (MC) and intensive organic (IO) treatments (yield 5.3 vs. 5.0 t ha−1 year−1). Significantly lower yields were observed under shade than full sun, but coffee morphology was similar. Low input organic production (LO) declined to zero under the shade of the non-legume timber tree Terminalia amazonia but when legume tree species were chosen (Erythrina poepiggiana, Chloroleucon eurycyclum) LO coffee yield was not significantly different than for IO. For the first 6 years, coffee yield was higher under the shade of timber trees (Chloroleucon and Terminalia), while in the subsequent 7 years, Erythrina systems were more productive; presumably this is due to lower shade covers. If IC full sun plantations are not affordable or desired in the future, organic production is an interesting alternative with similar productivity to MC management and in LO systems incorporation of legume tree species is shown to be essential.},

It provides water for several municipalities and its biosphere reserves are important tourist attractions. Much of the forest cover outside the core protected areas is in fact coffee grown under traditional forest shade. Unless this (agro)forest cover can be sustained, the biodiversity of the Sierra Madre and the environmental services it provides are at risk. We analyzed the threats to livelihoods and environment from climate change through crop suitability modeling based on downscaled climate scenarios for the period 2040 to 2069 (referred to as 2050s) and developed adaptation options through an expert workshop. Significant areas of forest and occasionally coffee are destroyed every year by wildfires, and this problem is bound to increase in a hotter and drier future climate. Widespread landslides and inundations, including on coffee farms, have recently been caused by hurricanes whose intensity is predicted to increase. A hotter climate with more irregular rainfall will be less favorable to the production of quality coffee and lower profitability may compel farmers to abandon shade coffee and expand other land uses of less biodiversity value, probably at the expense of forest. A comprehensive strategy to sustain the biodiversity, ecosystem services and livelihoods of the Sierra Madre in the face of climate change should include the promotion of biodiversity friendly coffee growing and processing practices including complex shade which can offer some hurricane protection and product diversification; payments for forest conservation and restoration from existing government programs complemented by private initiatives; diversification of income sources to mitigate risks associated with unstable environmental conditions and coffee markets; integrated fire management; development of markets that reward sustainable land use practices and forest conservation; crop insurance programs that are accessible to smallholders; and the strengthening of local capacity for adaptive resource management.},

In addition, the specific gravity of the studied species was determined.The total aboveground biomass of the shade trees varied between 3.5 and 386 kg per tree, and between 0.005 and 2.8 kg per plant for coffee. The aboveground biomass components (foliage, branch, and stem) are closely related with diameter at breast height (r {\textgreater} 0.75). The best-fit models for aboveground biomass of the shade trees were logarithmic, with adjusted R 2 between 0.71 and 0.97. In coffee plants, a high correlation was found (r = 0.84) with the stem diameter at 15 cm height, and the best-fit model was logarithmic, as well. The mean specific gravity was 0.52 (± 0.11) for trees and 0.82 (± 0.06) for coffee plants.},

	abstract = {Forest ecosystem dynamics emerges from nonlinear interactions between adaptive biotic agents (i.e., individual trees) and their relationship with a spatially and temporally heterogeneous abiotic environment. Understanding and predicting the dynamics resulting from these complex interactions is crucial for the sustainable stewardship of ecosystems, particularly in the context of rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here we present iLand (the individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model), a novel approach to simulating forest dynamics as an emergent property of environmental drivers, ecosystem processes and dynamic interactions across scales. Our specific objectives were (i) to describe the model, in particular its novel approach to simulate spatially explicit individual-tree competition for resources over large scales within a process-based framework of physiological resource use, and (ii) to present a suite of evaluation experiments assessing iLands ability to simulate tree growth and mortality for a wide range of forest ecosystems. Adopting an approach rooted in ecological field theory, iLand calculates a continuous field of light availability over the landscape, with every tree represented by a mechanistically derived, size- and species-dependent pattern of light interference. Within a hierarchical multi-scale framework productivity is derived at stand-level by means of a light-use efficiency approach, and downscaled to individuals via local light availability. Allocation (based on allometric ratios) and mortality (resulting from carbon starvation) are modeled at the individual-tree level, accounting for adaptive behavior of trees in response to their environment. To evaluate the model we conducted simulations over the extended environmental gradient of a longitudinal transect in Oregon, USA, and successfully compared results against independently observed productivity estimates (63.4\% of variation explained) and mortality patterns in even-aged stands. This transect experiment was furthermore replicated for a different set of species and ecosystems in the Austrian Alps, documenting the robustness and generality of our approach. Model performance was also successfully evaluated for structurally and compositionally complex old-growth forests in the western Cascades of Oregon. Finally, the ability of our approach to address forest ecosystem dynamics at landscape scales was demonstrated by a computational scaling experiment. In simulating the emergence of ecosystem patterns and dynamics as a result of complex process interactions across scales our approach has the potential to contribute crucial capacities to understanding and fostering forest ecosystem resilience under changing climatic conditions.},

This finite-element model integrates a three-dimensional description of tree architecture and is driven by fluctuating drag forces applied on all parts. For validation purposes, instantaneous wind velocities and wind-induced stem displacements of two trees were recorded in a mature Maritime pine stand (Pinus pinaster) at several heights. The tree geometrical and physical characteristics were measured to describe their architecture. No model parameter was adjusted. Tree motions appear to be driven by wind pulses reflecting turbulence intermittency. No evidence is found for resonant behaviour. In the mean wind direction, the simulated oscillations agree well with the measured time series. The underestimation of tree movement in the cross-stream direction outlines the importance of torque behaviour on the predictive accuracy of the model. The mechanical transfer functions of the modelled trees show vibration peak frequencies very similar to the measured ones. At higher frequencies, the simulated damping appears overestimated, with the set of parameters used. The model provides a sound basis to further investigate the influence of tree aerial architecture and turbulence structure on tree stability to wind.},

Influence mechanisms and combating strategies towards them have similarities to some extent. Impacts of air pollution and climate change have long been studied under IUFRO Research Group 7.01 and state of the art findings are presented at biannual meetings. Monitoring, modelling, assessment of multiple stressors, ecophysiology, and nutrient cycles have been thoroughly studied aspects of climate change and air pollution research for a long time under the umbrella of IUFRO RG 7.01. Recently, social and economic issues together with water relations are gaining more attention in parallel with science requirements on adaptation. In this paper, we summarise the main research needs emphasized at the recent 24th IUFRO RG 7.01 Conference titled \&\#8220;Adaptation of Forest Ecosystems to Air Pollution and Climate Change\&\#8221;. One important conclusion of the conference was the need for information on nutritional status of forest stands for sustainable forest management. It has been suggested to maintain long-term monitoring programs and to account for the effects of extreme years, and past and present management practices. Long-term monitoring can also help to understand the effects of forestry treatments on the nutrient and water budgets of the ecosystems which may enable to improve management practices like water saving silviculture.},

The parklands deliver multiple benefits, including fuelwood, soil nutrient replenishment, moisture conservation, and improved crop yield underneath the canopy. Its microclimate modification may provide an affordable climate adaptation strategy which needs to be explored. We carried out an on-farm experiment for three consecutive seasons in the Ethiopian Central Rift Valley with treatments of Faidherbia trees with bare soil underneath, wheat grown beneath Faidherbia and wheat grown in open fields. We tested the sensitivity of wheat yield to tree-mediated variables of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature and soil nitrogen, using APSIM-wheat model. Results showed that soil moisture in the sub-soil was the least for wheat with tree, intermediate for sole tree and the highest for open field. Presence of trees resulted in 35–55\% larger available N close to tree crowns compared with sole wheat. Trees significantly reduced PAR reaching the canopy of wheat growing underneath to optimum levels. Midday air temperature was about 6 °C less under the trees than in the open fields. LAI, number of grains spike−1, plant height, total aboveground biomass and wheat grain yield were all significantly higher (P \&lt; 0.001) for wheat associated with F. albida compared with sole wheat. Model-based sensitivity analysis showed that under moderate to high rates of N, wheat yield responded positively to a decrease in temperature caused by F. albida shade. Thus, F. albida trees increase soil mineral N, wheat water use efficiency and reduce heat stress, increasing yield significantly. With heat and moisture stress likely to be more prevalent in the face of climate change, F. albida, with its impact on microclimate modification, maybe a starting point to design more resilient and climate-smart farming systems.},

	abstract = {The advantages of associating shade trees in coffee agroforestry systems (AFS) are generally thought to be restricted mostly to poor soil and sub-optimal ecological conditions for coffee cultivation whereas their role in optimal conditions remains controversial. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate, under the optimal coffee cultivation conditions of the Central Valley of Costa Rica, the impact of Inga densiflora, a very common shade tree in Central America, on the microclimate, yield and vegetative development of shaded coffee in comparison to coffee monoculture (MC). Maximum temperature of shaded coffee leaves was reduced by up to 5°C relative to coffee leaf temperature in MC. The minimum air temperature at night was 0.5°C higher in AFS than air temperature in MC demonstrating the buffering effects of shade trees. As judged by the lower relative extractable water (REW) in the deep soil layers during the dry season, water use in AFS was higher than in MC. Nevertheless, competition for water between coffee and associated trees was assumed to be limited as REW in the 0–150 cm soil layer was always higher than 0.3 in shaded coffee compared to 0.4 in monoculture. Coffee production was quite similar in both systems during the establishment of shade trees, however a yield decrease of 30\% was observed in AFS compared to MC with a decrease in radiation transmittance to less than 40\% during the latter years in the absence of an adequate shade tree pruning. As a result of the high contribution (60\%) of shade trees to overall biomass, permanent aerial biomass accumulation in AFS amounted to two times the biomass accumulated in MC after 7 years. Thus provided an adequate pruning, Inga-shaded plantations appeared more advantageous than MC in optimal conditions, especially considering the fact that coffee AFS provides high quality coffee, farmers’ revenue diversification and environmental benefits.},

	abstract = {In modeling canopy photosynthesis, it is important to discriminate between the direct and diffuse components of incoming, global radiation. An equation is presented to estimate the share of both components from the measured daily global irradiance only. In this equation the share of the diffuse component is related to the ratio between global and extra-terrestrial radiation. This relation is based on a summary of literature data and of radiation measurements in The Netherlands. The diurnal trends of global, direct and diffuse radiation were derived from a sinusoid with a correction depending on solar angle. The random variation around this sine wave is characterized. For clear skies about 15\% of the diffuse flux comes predominantly from directions near the sun and this circumsolar component has to be added to the direct flux. On the other hand, for clear skies the diffuse fraction in the photosynthetically active wave bands is about 40\% larger than that for the total global radiation. In the past, the partitioning between direct and diffuse radiation was tackled by assuming that short periods of either fully clear or overcast conditions alternate within the day. That approach severely underestimated the share of the diffuse component in the total global radiation. The method presented in this paper is particularly useful for application in crop growth models.},

Climate change over the next 100 years is expected to have significant impacts on forest ecosystems. The forestry community needs to evaluate the long-term effects of climate change on forests and determine what the community might do now and in the future to respond to this threat. Management can influence the timing and direction of forest adaptation at selected locations, but in many situations society will have to adjust to however forests adapt. Adapting to climate change in the face of the uncertain timing of impacts means we must have a suite of readily available options. A high priority will be coping with and adapting to forest disturbance while maintaining the genetic diversity and resilience of forest ecosystems. A framework for facilitating adaptation in forestry is discussed and a review of adaptive actions presented.},

	abstract = {We describe the calibration and structure of a multi-species, two-scale light transmission model, and demonstrate its effectiveness for predicting instantaneous light availability at the stand scale across a wide range of forest stand compositions. The model, MIXLIGHT, calculates light transmission through the forest overstory at the stand or microsite scale using standard forest inventory data and two other parameters, foliage area density and foliage inclination. Since MIXLIGHT simulations on both scales are based on a list of individual tree characteristics, it allows for simple manipulation of stand structure to study the effects of silvicultural options on light availability. The two scales allow the input of various kinds of data, allowing predictions from data of different sources and completeness. A simple and rapid method of calibrating the foliage parameters for the species of interest is presented, using measurements of direct-beam light transmission measurements made in the shadows of newly isolated trees. In an independent validation, MIXLIGHT predicted light transmission at the stand level closely for 17 forest inventory plots with a wide range of density and species composition, during leaf-on and leaf-off seasons and under sunny and cloudy conditions. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the influence of the parameters in the model on stand level light transmission predictions was (highest to lowest): foliage area density, crown radius, crown length, and foliage inclination. Nonetheless, a test of the common assumption that the foliage is spherically inclined caused significant underestimation of light transmission. With this flexibility and demonstrated accuracy, we believe MIXLIGHT will provide an accessible and effective tool for forest stand management and regeneration modeling.},

	abstract = {Light interception capability is a critical factor affecting the growth, development, fruit yield and quality of fruit trees; thus, it is beneficial to cultivate optimal canopy types with high light interception efficiency. In this study, we present a quantitative method of analyzing light interception by tree canopies based on a virtual plant model. A detailed three-dimensional (3D) peach model with a natural growth shape was reconstructed and then the branches in the model were pruned to generate canopies with an open center form. These models were used to calculate the light interception and corresponding net photosynthesis. A solar radiation transfer model was used to determine the radiation intensity at the top of the canopy, and a ray tracing algorithm and turtle algorithm were utilized to simulate the spatial distribution of direct and diffuse radiation, respectively, in the tree canopy and obtain the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for each leaf. In the final step, we applied the photosynthesis model to calculate the canopy net photosynthetic rate. To compare the light interception efficiency among various plant canopy shapes, the net production rate at the whole-canopy scale and the average net photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area were calculated. The simulation results showed that peach canopies with an open center form provided better results compared with canopies with a natural form in terms of light penetration and air ventilation. Our method supports quantitative analysis of light interception and use efficiency for different types of canopy architectures at each time step and for individual leaf units. The approach was implemented in the interactive parametric individual 3D tree modeling software ParaTree. The extended ParaTree software is useful for fruit tree management applications because it provides an intuitive tool that can assist in tree pruning and design for ideal canopy architecture types.},

	issn = {00220957, 14602431},
	abstract = {Stomatal control of species with contrasting stomatal behaviours have been investigated under natural fluctuations of evaporative demand and soil water status. Sunflower and barley (anisohydric behaviour) have a daytime leaf water potential (\&\#x3c8;1) which markedly decreases with evaporative demand during the day and is lower in droughted than in watered plants. In contrast, maize and poplar (isohydric behaviour) maintain a nearly constant \&\#x3c8;1 during the day at a value which does not depend on soil water status until plants are close to death. Plants were also subjected to a range of soil water potentials under contrasting air vapour pressure deficits (VPD, from 0.5 to 3 kPa) in the field, in the greenhouse or in a growth chamber. Finally, plants or detached leaves were fed with varying concentrations of artificial ABA. Stomatal conductance of well-watered plants had no response to VPD when plants were grown in natural soils, suggesting that the opposite result observed in many laboratory experiments might be linked to the low unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of usual potting substrates. The response of stomatal conductance of all studied species to the concentration of ABA in pressurized xylem sap ([ABA]xyl) was the same whether ABA had an endogenous origin (droughted plants) or was artificially fed. However stomatal response of maize and poplar to [ABA]xyl markedly changed with varying evaporative demand or \&\#x3c8;1, whereas this was not the case in sunflower or barley. This suggests that isohydric behaviour is linked to an interaction between hydraulic and chemical information, while anisohydric behaviour is linked to an absence of interaction. In all cases, [ABA]xyl was related to soil water status with common relationships for different experimental conditions, but with markedly different responses among species. Diurnal variations of [ABA]xyl with evaporative demand were small in all studied species. Results are synthesized in a model which accounts for observed behaviours of gs, \&\#x3c8;1 and [ABA]xyl in fluctuating conditions and for several species. The validity of this model, in particular the physiological meaning of [ABA]xyl, is discussed.},

	abstract = {Heat conduction through the wires is one source of thermocouple (TC) error. Leaf temperature measurement may be affected by this error if the leaf-to-air temperature difference is large and contact between TC and leaf is inadequate. Selection of small diameter TCs with low thermal conductivity, as well as good contact with the leaf, are possible solutions to the problem. A laboratory experiment was carried out to determine conduction error as a function of TC-type, wire diameter, insulation and length of contact between wire and leaf. Most of the tests were conducted with a thin plastic plate, as a leaf-substitute, to ensure repetitiveness. Some measurements were also made with in vivo pepper and tomato leaves, to determine a correction factor. Different lengths of the TC wires were glued to the plate, or leaf, to ensure good contact. Controllable temperature differences were established with a thermo-electric cooler. A conduction error, τ, of 1\% (relative to the leaf-to-air temperature difference) is to be expected when a length of about 22 mm of AWG 40 (0.08 mm diameter), teflon-insulated type-T (copper–constantan) thermocouple is glued to a leaf. Removing the insulation reduces this length to 14 mm, and replacing the insulated type-T thermocouple by an insulated type-K (chromel–alumel) thermocouple of the same gage, requires about 10 mm for the same 1\% error. An approximate theoretical solution was obtained, which relates relative measurement error, τ, to normalized glued length, ξ, in the form τ = exp\{−ξ\}. This relationship can be used to estimate errors with other TCs.},

Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These “decadal predictions” are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive.

	abstract = {The subject of this paper, sun leaves are thicker and show higher photosynthetic rates than the shade leaves, is approached in two ways. The first seeks to answer the question: why are sun leaves thicker than shade leaves? To do this, CO2 diffusion within a leaf is examined first. Because affinity of Rubisco for CO2 is low, the carboxylation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is competitively inhibited by O2, and the oxygenation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate leads to energy-consuming photorespiration, it is essential for C3 plants to maintain the CO2 concentration in the chloroplast as high as possible. Since the internal conductance for CO2 diffusion from the intercellular space to the chloroplast stroma is finite and relatively small, C3 leaves should have sufficient mesophyll surfaces occupied by chloroplasts to secure the area for CO2 dissolution and transport. This explains why sun leaves are thicker. The second approach is mechanistic or 'how-oriented'. Mechanisms are discussed as to how sun leaves become thicker than shade leaves, in particular, the long-distance signal transduction from mature leaves to leaf primordia inducing the periclinal division of the palisade tissue cells.

In this paper thermal infrared radiation models are reviewed in reference to anisotropic emissions from the plant canopy. The biometeorological aspects of linking longwave models with plant canopy energy budgets and micrometeorology are discussed and a new model is described. Time variation of thermal infrared emission measurements is found to sometimes be interpreted as anisotropy.

	abstract = {Aim  To assess the influence of land cover and climate on species distributions across Europe. To quantify the importance of land cover to describe and predict species distributions after using climate as the main driver. Location  The study area is Europe. Methods  (1) A multivariate analysis was applied to describe land-cover distribution across Europe and assess if the land cover is determined by climate at large spatial scales. (2) To evaluate the importance of land cover to predict species distributions, we implemented a spatially explicit iterative procedure to predict species distributions of plants (2603 species), mammals (186 species), breeding birds (440 species), amphibian and reptiles (143 species). First, we ran bioclimatic models using stepwise generalized additive models using bioclimatic variables. Secondly, we carried out a regression of land cover (LC) variables against residuals from the bioclimatic models to select the most relevant LC variables. Finally, we produced mixed models including climatic variables and those LC variables selected as decreasing the residual of bioclimatic models. Then we compared the explanatory and predictive power of the pure bioclimatic against the mixed model. Results  (1) At the European coarse resolution, land cover is mainly driven by climate. Two bioclimatic axes representing a gradient of temperature and a gradient of precipitation explained most variation of land-cover distribution. (2) The inclusion of land cover improved significantly the explanatory power of bioclimatic models and the most relevant variables across groups were those not explained or poorly explained by climate. However, the predictive power of bioclimatic model was not improved by the inclusion of LC variables in the iterative model selection process. Main conclusion  Climate is the major driver of both species and land-cover distributions over Europe. Yet, LC variables that are not explained or weakly associated with climate (inland water, sea or arable land) are interesting to describe particular mammal, bird and tree distributions. However, the addition of LC variables to pure bioclimatic models does not improve their predictive accuracy.},

	abstract = {To support EU policy, indicators of pesticide leaching at the European level are required. For this reason, a metamodel of the spatially distributed European pesticide leaching model EuroPEARL was developed. EuroPEARL considers transient flow and solute transport and assumes Freundlich adsorption, first-order degradation and passive plant uptake of pesticides. Physical parameters are depth dependent while (bio)-chemical parameters are depth, temperature, and moisture dependent. The metamodel is based on an analytical expression that describes the mass fraction of pesticide leached. The metamodel ignores vertical parameter variations and assumes steady flow. The calibration dataset was generated with EuroPEARL and consisted of approximately 60,000 simulations done for 56 pesticides with different half-lives and partitioning coefficients. The target variable was the 80th percentile of the annual average leaching concentration at 1-m depth from a time series of 20 yr. The metamodel explains over 90\% of the variation of the original model with only four independent spatial attributes. These parameters are available in European soil and climate databases, so that the calibrated metamodel could be applied to generate maps of the predicted leaching concentration in the European Union. Maps generated with the metamodel showed a good similarity with the maps obtained with EuroPEARL, which was confirmed by means of quantitative performance indicators.},

Much of this literature is not quantitative, and it remains difficult to optimise growing area selection, shade tree use and management. To assist in this optimisation we developed a simple dynamic model of coffee agroforestry systems. The model includes the physiology of vegetative and reproductive growth of coffee plants, and its response to different growing conditions. This is integrated into a plot-scale model of coffee and shade tree growth which includes competition for light, water and nutrients and allows for management treatments such as spacing, thinning, pruning and fertilising. Because of the limited availability of quantitative information, model parameterisation remains fraught with uncertainty, but model behaviour seems consistent with observations. We show examples of how the model can be used to examine trade-offs between increasing coffee and tree productivity, and between maximising productivity and limiting the impact of the system on the environment.},

We derive a mathematical formula for crop LUE as a function of CO2, temperature, light intensity and the Rubisco content of upper leaves. A corollary formula is derived that expresses the sensitivity of crop growth rate to changes in Rubisco, under various conditions. Both formulas were incorporated in an existing wheat model, together with new equations that represent the effects of O3. Five parameters were defined that quantify O3 relations: (1) the amount of Rubisco damaged per unit O3, (2, 3) rate and metabolic costs of O3 detoxification, (4, 5) rate and costs of repair. For quantification of the damage coefficient and repair rate, equations were developed that can be applied to gas exchange measurements in plants subjected to stepwise increase in ambient ozone concentration. The model was parameterised for spring wheat using literature data. Model simulations were carried out for various time courses of O3, CO2, temperature, light intensity, to explain reports in the literature on variation in crop response to elevated CO2 and O3 under different climatic conditions. In spite of model simplicity, simulations explained much of reported variation in crop response to elevated levels of CO2 and O3. The need and use of additional experimentation is discussed, as is the scope for analysing plant defence strategies in terms of investment in detoxification and repair.},

In this paper, we examine data on the mitigation potential of agroforestry in the humid and sub-humid tropics. We then present the scientific evidence that leads to the expectation that agroforestry also has an important role in climate change adaptation, particularly for small holder farmers.

	abstract = {Arabica coffee production provides a livelihood to millions of people worldwide. Climate change impact studies consistently project a drastic decrease of Arabica yields in current production regions by 2050. However, none of these studies incorporated the beneficial effects that elevated CO2 concentrations are found to have on Arabica coffee yields, the so-called CO2 fertilization effect. To assess the impacts of climate change and elevated CO2 concentrations on the cultivation of Arabica coffee in Brazil, a coffee yield simulation model was extended with a CO2 fertilization and irrigation factor. The model was calibrated and validated with yield data from 1989 to 2013 of 42 municipalities in Brazil and found to perform satisfactorily in both the calibration (R 2 = 0.91, d = 0.96, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 8.58\%) and validation phases (R 2 = 0.96, d = 0.95, MAPE = 11.16\%). The model was run for the 42 municipalities from 1980 to 2010 with interpolated climate data and from 2040 to 2070 with climate data projected by five global circulation models according to the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. The model projects that yield losses due to high air temperatures and water deficit will increase, while losses due to frost will decrease. Nevertheless, extra losses are offset by the CO2 fertilization effect, resulting in a small net increase of the average Brazilian Arabica coffee yield of 0.8\% to 1.48 t ha−1 in 2040–2070, assuming growing locations and irrigation remain unchanged. Simulations further indicate that future yields can reach up to 1.81 t ha−1 provided that irrigation use is expanded.},

	abstract = {Evapotranspiration and energy partitioning are complex to estimate because they result from the interaction of many different processes, especially in multi-species and multi-strata ecosystems. We used MAESPA model, a mechanistic, 3D model of coupled radiative transfer, photosynthesis, and balances of energy and water, to simulate the partitioning of energy and evapotranspiration in homogeneous tree plantations, as well as in heterogeneous multi-species, multi-strata agroforests with diverse spatial scales and management schemes. The MAESPA model was modified to add (1) calculation of foliage surface water evaporation at the voxel scale; (2) computation of an average within-canopy air temperature and vapour pressure; and (3) use of (1) and (2) in iterative calculations of soil and leaf temperatures to close ecosystem-level energy balances. We tested MAESPA model simulations on a simple monospecific Eucalyptus stand in Brazil, and also in two complex, heterogeneous Coffea agroforests in Costa Rica. MAESPA satisfactorily simulated the daily and seasonal dynamics of net radiation (RMSE = 29.6 and 28.4 W m−2; R2 = 0.99 and 0.99 for Eucalyptus and Coffea sites respectively) and its partitioning between latent-(RMSE = 68.1 and 37.2 W m−2; R2 = 0.87 and 0.85) and sensible-energy (RMSE = 54.6 and 45.8 W m−2; R2 = 0.57 and 0.88) over a one-year simulation at half-hourly time-step. After validation, we use the modified MAESPA to calculate partitioning of evapotranspiration and energy between plants and soil in the above-mentioned agro-ecosystems. In the Eucalyptus plantation, 95\% of the outgoing energy was emitted as latent-heat, while the Coffea agroforestry system’s partitioning between sensible and latent-heat fluxes was roughly equal. We conclude that MAESPA process-based model has an appropriate balance of detail, accuracy, and computational speed to be applicable to simple or complex forest ecosystems and at different scales for energy and evapotranspiration partitioning.},

	abstract = {Agroforestry systems (AFS) are complex to model mainly due to the high spatial variability induced by the shade trees. Recently, the microclimate and light heterogeneity issue in AFS has been addressed using the 3D ecophysiological process-based model MAESPA (Charbonnier et al., 2013; Vezy et al., 2018). MAESPA surpassed the classical sun/shade dichotomy in AFS (Charbonnier et al., 2014) and provided continuous maps of e.g. available light, light-use-efficiency and canopy temperature within Coffea Agroforestry Systems (CAS). A step further was to design a crop model for Coffea grown under agroforestry that would benefit from this continuum to estimate ecosystem services on the long term and under climate change scenarios. We designed DynA\_Cof, a new process-based growth and yield model to compute plot-scale net and gross primary productivity, carbon allocation, growth, yield, energy, and water balance of CAS according to shade tree species and management, while accounting for fine-scale spatial effects using MAESPA metamodels (Figure 1). DynA\_Cof satisfactorily simulated the daily plot-scale gross primary productivity (RMSE= 1.69 gC m-2 d-1 on 1562 days) and the energy and water balances (RMSE: AET= 0.63 mm d-1, H= 1.27 MJ m-2 d-1, Rn= 1.98 MJ m-2 d-1) compared to measurements from an eddy-flux tower in Aquiares (Costa Rica) and also the NPP for above and below-ground organs, coffee bean yield and shade tree wood production compared to a comprehensive database from this site.},

Mean leaf CC differed between ecosystems, with the highest and lowest CC in the tundra and rain forest, respectively. Leaf CC was positively correlated with lipid concentration. Leaf size (log) and specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area per leaf dry mass) were negatively correlated with leaf CC. Leaf CC did not show differences between different leaf life-spans or ecosystems when leaf size (log) or SLA were included as covariates. * • The small differences in leaf CC among leaf life-span types and ecosystems (6\% and 23\%, respectively) suggest that SLA is more important in determining differences in the carbon balance between species than leaf CC. Leaf size is shown to be an important trait associated with other leaf characteristics.

	abstract = {With the world’s population set to increase by 65\% (3.7 billion) by ∼2050, the additional food required to feed future generations will put further enormous pressure on freshwater resources. This is because agriculture is the largest single user of fresh water, accounting for ∼75\% of current human water use. At present ∼7\% of the world’s population live in areas where water is scarce. This is predicted to rise to a staggering 67\% of the world’s population by 2050. Because of this water scarcity and because new arable land is also limited, future increases in production will have to come mainly by growing more food on existing land and water. This paper looks at how this might be achieved by examining the efficiency with which water is used in agriculture. Globally, in both irrigated and rain fed agriculture only about 10–30\% of the available water (as rainfall, surface or groundwater) is used by plants as transpiration. In arid and semi-arid areas, where water is scarce and population growth is high, this figure is nearer 5\% in rain fed crops. There is, therefore, great potential for improving water use efficiency in agriculture, particularly, in those areas where the need is greatest. The technical basis for improving agricultural water use efficiency is illustrated. This may be achieved by increasing the total amount of the water resource that is made available to plants for transpiration and/or by increasing the efficiency with which transpired water produces biomass. It is concluded that there is much scope for improvement, particularly, in the former and that future global change research should shift its emphasis to addressing this real and immediate challenge.},

	abstract = {Changes in the Earth's atmosphere are expected to influence the growth, and therefore, carbon accumulation of European forests. We identify three major changes: (1) a rise in carbon dioxide concentration, (2) climate change, resulting in higher temperatures and changes in precipitation and (3) a decrease in nitrogen deposition. We adjusted and applied the hydrological model Watbal, the soil model SMART2 and the vegetation model SUMO2 to asses the effect of expected changes in the period 1990 up to 2070 on the carbon accumulation in trees and soils of 166 European forest plots. The models were parameterized using measured soil and vegetation parameters and site-specific changes in temperature, precipitation and nitrogen deposition. The carbon dioxide concentration was assumed to rise uniformly across Europe. The results were compared to a reference scenario consisting of a constant CO2 concentration and deposition scenario. The temperature and precipitation scenario was a repetition of the period between 1960 and 1990. All scenarios were compared to the reference scenario for biomass growth and carbon sequestration for both the soil and the trees. The predicted effects of changes in climate, CO2 concentration and nitrogen deposition on carbon sequestration by trees depend largely on tree species and location (latitude). The assumed decrease in nitrogen deposition causes a decrease of carbon accumulation all over Europe and for all modelled tree species. A rise in carbon dioxide concentration gives a rise in carbon accumulation all over Europe. Climate change gives a mixed result, with a decrease in carbon accumulation in the South of Europe and an increase in the North. When the scenarios are combined, an increase in biomass accumulation is predicted at most of the sites, with a rise in growth rate mostly between 0 and 100\%. The predicted effects of a change in climate, CO2 concentration and nitrogen deposition on soil carbon sequestration is generally lower than the effect on carbon sequestration by the trees. However, the magnitude is similar as is the location effect (latitude). A net carbon release was predicted at several sites in the south due to the effect of climate change. Overall, we conclude that where nitrogen deposition was a major driver for a change in forest growth in the past, it is climate change, and to a lesser extent CO2 change, that will influence forest growth in the future.},

In this review, we discuss the importance of scaling, moving from leaf-level responses to those of the canopy, and from short-term to long-term responses of vegetation to climate change. While our knowledge of leaf-level, instantaneous responses of photosynthesis, respiration, stomatal conductance, transpiration and water-use efficiency to elevated CO(2) and temperature is quite good, our ability to scale these responses up to larger spatial and temporal scales is less developed. We highlight which physiological processes are least understood at various levels of study, and discuss how ignoring differences in the spatial or temporal scale of a physiological process impedes our ability to predict how forest carbon and water fluxes forests will be altered in the future. We also synthesize data from the literature to show that light respiration follows a generalized temperature response across studies, and that the light compensation point of photosynthesis is reduced by elevated growth CO(2). Lastly, we emphasize the need to move beyond single factorial experiments whenever possible, and to combine both CO(2) and temperature treatments in studies of tree performance.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10342-009-0339-6},
	abstract = {Recent advances in traditional forest growth models have been achieved by linking growth predictions to key ecophysiological processes in a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both empirical and process-based models. A hybrid model was constructed for intensively managed Douglas-fir plantations in the Pacific Northwest, USA, by embedding components representing fundamental physiological processes and detailed tree allometrics into an empirical growth model for projecting individual tree and stand development. The simulated processes operated at a variety of scales ranging from individual branches to trees and stands. The canopy structure submodel improved predictions of leaf area index at the stand level when compared to allometric and other empirical approaches (reducing mean square error by 30–42\%). In addition, the hybrid model achieved accuracy in short-term volume growth prediction comparable to an empirical model. Biases in 4-year stand growth predictions from the hybrid model were similar to those from the empirical model under thinning, fertilization, and the combination of these treatments; however, volume growth predictions in unmanaged plantations averaged approximately 36\% less bias. These improvements were attributed to detailed information on crown structure (i.e. size, location, and foliage mass of primary branches), simple representation of key physiological processes, and improved site characterization. Soil moisture, temperature, and nitrogen mineralization predicted by the hybrid model also agreed closely with observed values from several previous studies. Overall, the model framework will be helpful for future analyses as it can lend insight into the influence of weather and site edaphic factors on growth, help identify mechanisms of response to silvicultural treatments, and facilitate the design of sound management regimes for Douglas-fir plantations across the Pacific Northwest region.},

A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply. However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health. The evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a “climate-smart food system” that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security.},

However, their potential contribution to crop productivity needs to be assessed under realistic field conditions. Using 31 year weather data, we ran the crop model GECROS for rice in tropical, subtropical, and temperate environments, to evaluate the following routes: (1) improving mesophyll conductance (gm); (2) improving Rubisco specificity (Sc/o); (3) improving both gm and Sc/o; (4) introducing C4 biochemistry; (5) introducing C4 Kranz anatomy that effectively minimizes CO2 leakage; (6) engineering the complete C4 mechanism; (7) engineering cyanobacterial bicarbonate transporters; (8) engineering a more elaborate cyanobacterial CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) with the carboxysome in the chloroplast; and (9) a mechanism that combines the low ATP cost of the cyanobacterial CCM and the high photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf nitrogen. All routes improved crop mass production, but benefits from Routes 1, 2, and 7 were {\textless}/=10\%. Benefits were higher in the presence than in the absence of drought, and under the present climate than for the climate predicted for 2050. Simulated crop mass differences resulted not only from the increased canopy photosynthesis competence but also from changes in traits such as light interception and crop senescence. The route combinations gave larger effects than the sum of the effects of the single routes, but only Route 9 could bring an advantage of {\textgreater}/=50\% under any environmental conditions. To supercharge crop productivity, exploring a combination of routes in improving the CCM, photosynthetic capacity, and quantum efficiency is required.},

	abstract = {Day respiration (R(d)) is an important parameter in leaf ecophysiology. It is difficult to measure directly and is indirectly estimated from gas exchange (GE) measurements of the net photosynthetic rate (A), commonly using the Laisk method or the Kok method. Recently a new method was proposed to estimate R(d) indirectly from combined GE and chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) measurements across a range of low irradiances. Here this method is tested for estimating R(d) in five C(3) and one C(4) crop species. Values estimated by this new method agreed with those by the Laisk method for the C(3) species. The Laisk method, however, is only valid for C(3) species and requires measurements at very low CO(2) levels. In contrast, the new method can be applied to both C(3) and C(4) plants and at any CO(2) level. The R(d) estimates by the new method were consistently somewhat higher than those by the Kok method, because using CF data corrects for errors due to any non-linearity between A and irradiance of the used data range. Like the Kok and Laisk methods, the new method is based on the assumption that R(d) varies little with light intensity, which is still subject to debate. Theoretically, the new method, like the Kok method, works best for non-photorespiratory conditions. As CF information is required, data for the new method are usually collected using a small leaf chamber, whereas the Kok and Laisk methods use only GE data, allowing the use of a larger chamber to reduce the noise-to-signal ratio of GE measurements.},

	abstract = {The evolution of natural ecosystems is controled by a high level of biodiversity, In sharp contrast, intensive agricultural systems involve monocultures associated with high input of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. Intensive agricultural systems have clearly negative impacts on soil and water quality and on biodiversity conservation. Alternatively, cropping systems based on carefully designed species mixtures reveal many potential advantages under various conditions, both in temperate and tropical agriculture. This article reviews those potential advantages by addressing the reasons for mixing plant species; the concepts and tools required for understanding and designing cropping systems with mixed species; and the ways of simulating multispecies cropping systems with models. Multispecies systems are diverse and may include annual and perennial crops on a gradient of complexity from 2 to n species. A literature survey shows potential advantages such as (1) higher overall productivity, (2) better control of pests and diseases, (3) enhanced ecological services and (4) greater economic profitability. Agronomic and ecological conceptual frameworks are examined for a clearer understanding of cropping systems, including the concepts of competition and facilitation, above- and belowground interactions and the types of biological interactions between species that enable better pest management in the system. After a review of existing models, future directions in modelling plant mixtures are proposed. We conclude on the need to enhance agricultural research on these multispecies systems, combining both agronomic and ecological concepts and tools.},

The maximum nad for the entire needle population within the tree crowns was located approximately one-third of tree-crown length from the crown base in the vertical and half-way along the crown radious at that height in the horizontal. The relative heights of maximum nad of needles in different age classes decrease with needle age in the vertical, whilst the relative radial distances of maximum nad of needles in different age classes are close to the centre of the tree crown in the horizontal. It was found that the maximum nad within the tree crown can be up to four times larger than the average nad. The spatial nad distribution was poorly related to trunk diameter at breast height, tree height, and the total area of needles within the crown. The spatial nad distributions of leaves in different age classes were altered by irrigation and fertilization: the relative proportion of current needles increased, and the location of maximum nad of current needles shifted towards the crown base in the vertical and the crown centre in the horizontal. The spatial nad distribution of the entire needle population was unaffected by irrigation and fertilization.},

It has been widely evaluated at the canopy scale, where aerodynamic and canopy resistance to water vapour are difficult to estimate directly, leading to various empirical corrections when scaling from leaf to canopy. Here, we evaluated the PM equation directly at the leaf scale, using a detailed leaf energy balance model and direct measurements in a controlled, insulated wind tunnel using artificial leaves with fixed and predefined stomatal conductance. Experimental results were consistent with a detailed leaf energy balance model; however, the results revealed systematic deviations from PM-predicted fluxes, which pointed to fundamental problems with the PM equation. Detailed analysis of the derivation by Monteith(1965) and subsequent amendments revealed two errors: one in neglecting two-sided exchange of sensible heat by a planar leaf, and the other related to the representation of hypostomatous leaves, which are very common in temperate climates. The omission of two-sided sensible heat flux led to bias in simulated latent heat flux by the PM equation, which was as high as 50 \% of the observed flux in some experiments. Furthermore, we found that the neglect of feedbacks between leaf temperature and radiative energy exchange can lead to additional bias in both latent and sensible heat fluxes. A corrected set of analytical solutions for leaf temperature as well as latent and sensible heat flux is presented, and comparison with the original PM equation indicates a major improvement in reproducing experimental results at the leaf scale. The errors in the original PM equation and its failure to reproduce experimental results at the leaf scale (for which it was originally derived) propagate into inaccurate sensitivities of transpiration and sensible heat fluxes to changes in atmospheric conditions, such as those associated with climate change (even with reasonable present-day performance after calibration). The new formulation presented here rectifies some of the shortcomings of the PM equation and could provide a more robust starting point for canopy representation and climate change studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Amphistomaty occurs predominantly in fast-growing herbaceous annuals and in slow-growing perennial shrubs and trees. In this paper, we present the current understanding and hypotheses on the costs and benefits of amphistomaty related to water and CO2 transport in contrasting leaf morphologies. First, there is no evidence that amphistomatous species achieve higher stomatal densities on a projected leaf area basis than hypostomatous species, but two-sided gas exchange is less limited by boundary layer effects. Second, amphistomaty may provide a specific advantage in thick leaves by shortening the pathway for CO2 transport between the atmosphere and the chloroplasts. In thin leaves of fast-growing herbaceous annuals, in which both the adaxial and abaxial pathways are already short, amphistomaty enhances leaf–atmosphere gas-exchange capacity. Third, amphistomaty may help to optimise the leaf-interior water status for CO2 transport by reducing temperature gradients and so preventing the condensation of water that could limit CO2 diffusion. Fourth, a potential cost of amphistomaty is the need for additional investments in leaf water transport tissue to balance the water loss through the adaxial surface.},

Many LSMs do not correctly capture plant respiration and growth fluxes, particularly in response to extreme climatic events. This is in part due to the unrealistic assumption that total plant carbon expenditure (PCE) is always equal to gross carbon accumulation by photosynthesis. We present and evaluate a simple model of labile carbon storage and utilisation (SUGAR), designed to be integrated into an LSM, that allows simulated plant respiration and growth to vary independently of photosynthesis. SUGAR buffers simulated PCE against seasonal variation in photosynthesis, producing more constant (less variable) predictions of plant growth and respiration relative to an LSM that does not represent labile carbon storage. This allows the model to more accurately capture observed carbon fluxes at a large-scale drought experiment in a tropical moist forest in the Amazon, relative to the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator LSM (JULES). SUGAR is designed to improve the representation of carbon storage in LSMs and provides a simple framework that allows new processes to be integrated as the empirical understanding of carbon storage in plants improves. The study highlights the need for future research into carbon storage and allocation in plants, particularly in response to extreme climate events such as drought.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Woody perennials’ reliance on nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) reserves for the resumption of spring growth necessitates an accumulation of NSC prior to dormancy. It is assumed that during dormancy temperature-regulated biological activities gauge the progression of winter and affect the metabolic rates and physiology of NSC reserves. Thus, changes in temperature signal the arrival of spring and determine the amount of reserves available for growth resumption. As woody perennials are dependent on dispersed storage of NSC during spring, they need an integrated remobilization and redistribution for synchronous and effective development of photosynthetic and reproductive organs. However, it is not known how storage compartments interact at the whole plant level, when NSC reserves are mobilized, or how local and distal storage compartments influence the biology of spring growth resumption. The goal of this mini-review is to shift the focus of winter biology from bud-centric to the whole plant. We discuss winter NSC management in the context of climate change with a special emphasis on how projected mild winters may affect the carbon budget, transport, and allocation during winter. We look at three aspects of NSC regulation underlying dormancy (I) the molecular regulation of dormancy (II) temperature dependent winter NSC metabolism, and (III) spring NSC remobilization and redistribution processes.},

This study analyses the impact of young shade trees (Cinnamomum camphora, Bishofia javanica and Jacaranda mimosifolia) on microclimate, coffee fruit development cycle, coffee yield, and coffee quality only 4 years after their introduction. The results show that young shade trees reduced diurnal fluctuations in temperatures, buffered high temperatures in the rainy season (−3 to −6°C), and protected coffee trees from cold temperatures in the dry season (+0.5 to +1°C). Coffee flower set decreased with shade intensity, as did fruit losses during the bean filling and maturation stages. Consequently, coffee trees under B. javanica and J. mimosifolia, which both provide light shade intensity, produced yields similar to those of coffee trees in open conditions. Only coffee trees under the dense shade of C. camphora had lower yields. Shade trees did not affect the physical and organoleptic attributes of coffee beans. This study hence demonstrates that carefully selected shade trees can rapidly provide positive ecosystem services related to microclimate and coffee physiology, while maintaining a coffee yield and quality similar to those found in monoculture coffee systems. With their diffused shade, B. javanica and J. mimosifolia are suitable options for the agro-ecological intensification of coffee systems, while the use of C. camphora requires active management and pruning practices in order to sustain high coffee yield.},

For favourable reception of models, a systematic accrual of a good knowledge base is crucial for both science and decision-making. As the roles of models grow in importance, there is an increase in the need for appropriate methods with which to test their quality and performance. For biophysical models, the heterogeneity of data and the range of factors inﬂuencing usefulness of their outputs often make it diﬃcult for full analysis and assessment. As a result, modelling studies in the domain of natural sciences often lack elements of good modelling practice related to model validation, that is correspondence of models to its intended purpose. Here we review validation issues and methods currently available for assessing the quality of biophysical models. The review covers issues of validation purpose, the robustness of model results, data quality, model prediction and model complexity. The importance of assessing input data quality and interpretation of phenomena is also addressed. Details are then provided on the range of measures commonly used for validation. Requirements for a methodology for assessment during the entire model-cycle are synthesised. Examples are used from a variety of modelling studies which mainly include agronomic modelling, e.g. crop growth and development, climatic modelling, e.g. climate scenarios, and hydrological modelling, e.g. soil hydrology, but the principles are essentially applicable to any area. It is shown that conducting detailed validation requires multi-faceted knowledge, and poses substantial scientiﬁc and technical challenges. Special emphasis is placed on using combined multiple statistics to expand our horizons in validation whilst also tailoring the validation requirements to the speciﬁc objectives of the application.},

	abstract = {Leaves are photosynthetic organs that absorb light and convert the photon energy of light to chemical energy for use in CO2 assimilation. Here we review how CO2 assimilation rates vary, depending on environmental factors and among leaves. Net CO2 assimilation is a balance between the carboxylation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) catalyzed by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and the release of CO2 by photorespiration and mitochondrial respiration. The steady-state biochemical model of CO2 assimilation considers photosynthetic metabolism as a composite of two processes, namely, RuBP carboxylation and regeneration. The former, modeled based on the Rubisco kinetics, is limited mainly by CO2 supply, whereas the latter is assumed to be limited by the rate of photon absorption at low light and by its use in electron transport at high light. CO2 concentration at the assimilation sites in chloroplasts depends on the stomatal and mesophyll conductances for CO2 diffusion. Both these conductances are sensitive to environmental variables, but no mechanistic models of environmental responses for these conductances are available. Various empirical models have been developed and combined with the biochemical photosynthesis model allowing for expression of CO2 assimilation rates as a function of environmental variables.},

Although enclosure should be rapid to minimize plant disturbances, longer TWs (3 min) increase confidence in flux estimates. Indeterminate stabilization periods in existing calculation protocols cause significant systematic errors. Stabilization times were identified via the change-point detection method, and flux uncertainties were reduced. Photosynthesis was overestimated by up to 28 \% when not correcting the evolving CO2 molar fraction for water vapour dilution. Leakage can compromise flux estimates, but was negligible (ca. 2 \%) here due to the large chamber-headspace and relatively small values of both collar contact length and closure time.ConclusionsA bootstrapping, resampling-based flux calculation method is presented and recommended to better assess random errors and improve flux precision.

	abstract = {High-throughput phenotyping technologies have become an increasingly important topic of crop science in recent years. Various sensors and data acquisition approaches have been applied to acquire the phenotyping traits. It is quite confusing for crop phenotyping researchers to determine an appropriate way for their application. In this study, three representative three-dimensional (3D) data acquisition approaches, including 3D laser scanning, multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction, and 3D digitizing, were evaluated for maize plant phenotyping in multi growth stages. Phenotyping traits accuracy, post-processing difficulty, device cost, data acquisition efficiency, and automation were considered during the evaluation process. 3D scanning provided satisfactory point clouds for medium and high maize plants with acceptable efficiency, while the results were not satisfactory for small maize plants. The equipment used in 3D scanning is expensive, but is highly automatic. MVS reconstruction provided satisfactory point clouds for small and medium plants, and point deviations were observed in upper parts of higher plants. MVS data acquisition, using low-cost cameras, exhibited the highest efficiency among the three evaluated approaches. The one-by-one pipeline data acquisition pattern allows the use of MVS high-throughput in further phenotyping platforms. Undoubtedly, enhancement of point cloud processing technologies is required to improve the extracted phenotyping traits accuracy for both 3D scanning and MVS reconstruction. Finally, 3D digitizing was time-consuming and labor intensive. However, it does not depend on any post-processing algorithms to extract phenotyping parameters and reliable phenotyping traits could be derived. The promising accuracy of 3D digitizing is a better verification choice for other 3D phenotyping approaches. Our study provides clear reference about phenotyping data acquisition of maize plants, especially for the affordable and portable field phenotyping platforms to be developed.},

	abstract = {A new method was developed for reconstructing the geometric structure of large plants such as trees at the leaf-scale by utilizing terrestrial LiDAR data. The primary goal of the work was to develop a feasible means for accurately and rapidly reconstructing or “digitizing” entire trees in order to specify the position, orientation, and size of every leaf in digital tree models that provide geometric inputs for high-resolution biophysical models or analyses. As with any optical measurement technique, a primary challenge is accurately accounting for plant matter that is occluded from view of the sensor. The present method is termed “semi-direct” because it uses a triangulation procedure to approximately directly reconstruct as many leaves as possible that are in view of the scanner. For plant matter obstructed from view, a statistical backfilling procedure was used to add additional leaves such that the three-dimensional distribution of leaf area and orientation of the reconstructed plant matched that of the actual plant on average. In a best case scenario such as when leaf density is low, nearly all leaf area is directly reconstructed from the scan and the branch and clumping structure is preserved within the reconstruction. In the worst case scenario such as when the leaf density is very high and nearly all leaves are occluded from view of the scanner, only a small fraction of leaves can be directly reconstructed, but at a minimum the distribution of leaf area and the leaf angle distribution across the reconstructed plant will be consistent with that of the actual plant. Unlike many other approaches, the present method does not rely on the woody matter of the plant to provide a skeleton for reconstruction, and can be used in dense plants where little woody matter is visible from the scanner.},

	doi = {10.1093/aob/mcw153},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Costa Rica, coffee (Coffea arabica) plants are often grown in agroforests. However, it is not known if shade-inducing trees reduce coffee plant biomass through root competition, and hence alter overall net primary productivity (NPP). We estimated biomass and NPP at the stand level, taking into account deep roots and the position of plants with regard to trees.
METHODS: Stem growth and root biomass, turnover and decomposition were measured in mixed coffee/tree (Erythrina poeppigiana) plantations. Growth ring width and number at the stem base were estimated along with stem basal area on a range of plant sizes. Root biomass and fine root density were measured in trenches to a depth of 4 m. To take into account the below-ground heterogeneity of the agroforestry system, fine root turnover was measured by sequential soil coring (to a depth of 30 cm) over 1 year and at different locations (in full sun or under trees and in rows/inter-rows). Allometric relationships were used to calculate NPP of perennial components, which was then scaled up to the stand level.
KEY RESULTS: Annual ring width at the stem base increased up to 2·5 mm yr-1 with plant age (over a 44-year period). Nearly all (92 \%) coffee root biomass was located in the top 1·5 m, and only 8 \% from 1·5 m to a depth of 4 m. Perennial woody root biomass was 16 t ha-1 and NPP of perennial roots was 1·3 t ha-1 yr-1 Fine root biomass (0-30 cm) was two-fold higher in the row compared with between rows. Fine root biomass was 2·29 t ha-1 (12 \% of total root biomass) and NPP of fine roots was 2·96 t ha-1 yr-1 (69 \% of total root NPP). Fine root turnover was 1·3 yr-1 and lifespan was 0·8 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Coffee root systems comprised 49 \% of the total plant biomass; such a high ratio is possibly a consequence of shoot pruning. There was no significant effect of trees on coffee fine root biomass, suggesting that coffee root systems are very competitive in the topsoil.},

The whole millet root system (0-200 cm) was sampled also in 2 m trenches, totalizing 4 millet holes, where all roots were sorted by layer. The whole plot harvest will allow extrapolating yield from subplots, through UAV images. Millet yield per unit ground area was about 3 times higher below FA, with still a positive influence at 2.5 x crown radius and less impacts of pests close to FA. In the trenches, we noted higher soil humidity and SOC close to the FA trunks. This observatory is open for collaboration.},

We set a new long-term observatory up for the monitoring and modelling of microclimate, GHG and deep SOC in a semi-arid agro-sylvo-pastoral system (Niakhar, Sénégal), dominated by the multipurpose Faidherbia albida tree. Crops were mainly millet and peanut, under annual rotation. Transhumant livestock contributed largely to manure, SOM and soil fertility. Early 2018, we installed 3 eddy-covariance towers above (i) the whole mosaic, (ii) millet and (iii) peanut and monitored energy, CO2 balance and evapotranspiration for one full year. The mosaic ecosystem displayed low but significant CO2 and H2O fluxes during the dry season, owing to Faidherbia in leaf (Fig. 1). When rains resumed, the soil bursted a large amount of CO2. Just after the raising of millet, CO2 uptake by photosynthesis increased dramatically, then stabilized before harvest. However, this was compensated by large ecosystem respiration. The annual ecosystem CO2 balance was close to nil. This observatory is currently installing soil chambers for GHG fluxes, studying the horizontal variability of SOC by Vis-NIR and of deep soil roots and C using wells. Microclimate (land surface temperature, energy balance and gas exchanges) and light-use-efficiency will be mapped through 3D modelling (Charbonnier et al., 2017; Vezy et al., 2018).

	isbn = {978-2-87614-743-0},
	abstract = {Although large amounts of potassium (K) are applied in tropical crops and planted forests, little is known about the interaction between K nutrition and water supply regimes on water resources in tropical regions. This interaction is a major issue because climate change is expected to increase the length of drought periods in many tropical regions and soil water availability in deep soil layers is likely to have a major influence on tree growth during dry periods in tropical planted forests. In this study, we described a modeling approach to quantify water fluxes in a Eucalyptus throughfall exclusion experiment in Brazil to gain insight into the combined effects of K deficiency and rainfall reduction (37\% throughfall exclusion) on the water used by the trees, soil water storage and water table fluctuations over the first 4.5 years after planting. Although the mean water withdrawal from depths of over 10 m amounted to only 5\% of canopy transpiration in K-fertilized plantation with undisturbed rainfall (+K+W), the proportion of water taken up near the water-table was much higher during dry periods. Under contrasted K availability, water withdrawal was more superficial for -K than for +K. Under rainfall exclusion, water was withdrawn in deeper soil layers for -W than for +W, particularly over dry seasons. A comparison of canopy transpiration in each plot with the values predicted for the same soil with the water content maintained at field capacity, made it possible to calculate a soil-driven tree water stress index for each treatment. The soil-driven tree water stress index was 166\% higher over the first 4.5 years after planting for -W than for +W, 76\% lower for -K than for +K, and 14\% lower for -K-W than for +K+W. Over the study period, deep seepage was higher by 371 mm yr-1 (+122\%) for -K than for +K and lower by 200 mm yr-1 (-66\%) for -W than for +W. Deep seepage was lower by 44\% for -K-W than for +K+W. At the end of the study period, the model predicted a higher water table for -K (10 mbs for -K+W and 16 mbs for -K-W) than for +K (16 mbs for +K+W and 18 mbs for +K-W). Our study suggests that the depth of the soil should be a major criterion for the selection of future afforestation areas and that flexible fertilization regimes could contribute to adjusting the local trade-off between wood production and demand for soil water resources in planted forests.},

	abstract = {The DynACof model was designed to model coffee agroforestry systems and study the trade-offs to e.g. optimize the system facing climate changes. The model simulates net primary productivity (NPP), growth, yield, mortality, energy and water balance of coffee agroforestry systems according to shade tree species and management. Several plot-scale ecosystem services are simulated by the model, such as production, canopy cooling effect, or potential C sequestration. DynACof uses metamodels derived from a detailed 3D process-based model (MAESPA) to account for complex spatial effects, while running fast. It also includes a coffee flower bud and fruit cohort module to better distribute fruit carbon demand over the year, a key feature to obtain a realistic competition between sinks. The model was parameterized and evaluated using a highly comprehensive database on a coffee agroforestry experimental site in Costa Rica. The fluxes simulated by the model were close to the measurements over a 5-year period (nRMSE = 26.27 for gross primary productivity; 28.22 for actual evapo-transpiration, 53.91 for sensible heat flux and 15.26 for net radiation), and DynACof satisfactorily simulated the yield, NPP, mortality and carbon stock for each coffee organ type over a 35-year rotation.},

	abstract = {Huit ans de travaux de recherche sur les services écosystémiques dans une grande ferme caféière du Costa Rica (observatoire collaboratif Coffee-Flux, en système agroforestier à base de caféiers sous de grands arbres d'Erythrina poeppigiana, surface projetée de couronne de l'ordre de 16 \%) ont suggéré plusieurs applications pour les agriculteurs et les décideurs. Il est apparu que de nombreux services écosystémiques dépendaient des propriétés du sol (ici des Andisols), en particulier de l'érosion, de l'infiltration, de la capacité de stockage de l'eau et des éléments nutritifs. Nous confirmons qu'il est essentiel de lier les services hydrologiques et de conservation au type de sol en présence. Une densité adéquate d'arbres d'ombrage (plutôt faible ici) permet de réduire la sévérité des maladies foliaires avec, en perspective, une réduction de l'usage de pesticides-fongicides. Un simple inventaire de la surface basale au collet des caféiers permet d'estimer la biomasse souterraine et la moyenne d'âge d'une plantation de caféiers, ce qui permet d'évaluer sa valeur marchande ou de planifier son remplacement. Le protocole de calcul actuel pour la neutralité carbone des systèmes agroforestiers ne prend en compte que les arbres d'ombrage, pas la culture intercalaire. Dans la réalité, si on inclut les caféiers, on se rapproche très probablement de la neutralité. Des évaluations plus complètes, incluant les arbres, les caféiers, la litière, le sol et les racines dans le bilan en carbone du système agroforestier sont proposées. Les arbres d'ombrage offrent de nombreux servies écosystémiques s'ils sont gérés de manière adéquate dans le contexte local. Par rapport aux parcelles en plein soleil, nous montrons qu'ils réduisent l'érosion laminaire d'un facteur 2, augmentent la fixation de l'azote (N2) atmosphérique et le pourcentage d'azote recyclé dans le système, réduisant ainsi les besoins en engrais. Ils réduisent aussi la sévérité des maladies foliaires, augmentent la séquestration de carbone, améliorent le microclimat et atténuent substantiellement les effets des changements climatiques. Dans notre étude de cas, aucun effet négatif sur le rendement n'a été enregistré.},

	abstract = {Eight years of studying coffee ecophysiology and monitoring ecosystem services (ES) in a large coffee farm in Costa Rica revealed several practical recommendations for farmers and policy makers. The cropping system studied within our collaborative observatory (Coffee-Flux) corresponds to a coffee-based agroforestry system (AFS) under the shade of large trees of Erythrina poeppigiana (16 \% of canopy cover). A lot of ES and disservices depend on local soil properties (here Andisols), especially erosion/infiltration, water/carbon and nutrient storage capacity. Therefore, for ES assessment, the type of soil is crucial. An adequate density of shade trees (rather low here) reduced the severity of leaf diseases with the prospect of reducing pesticide-fungicide use. A simple inventory of the basal area at collar of the coffee plants allowed estimating the belowground biomass and the average age of the plantation, to judge of its market value and to decide when to replace it. Coffee farms are probably much closer to C neutrality than predicted by the current C-Neutral protocol, which only considers shade trees. More comprehensive assessments, including trees, coffee, litter, soil, and roots in the C balance of the AFS are proposed. Shade trees offer many ES if they are adequately managed in the local context. As compared to full sun conditions, shade trees may (i) reduce laminar erosion by a factor of 2, (ii) increase N2 fixation and the \% of N recycled into the system, thus reducing fertilizer requirements, (iii) reduce the severity of leaf diseases, (iv) increase C sequestration, (v) improve the microclimate, and (vi) substantially reduce the effects of climate change. In our case study, no negative effect on coffee yield was found.},

	abstract = {The paradigm of functional-structural models (FSPM) assumes that studying the detailed organisation of plant structure allows a better understanding of functional processes; in particular the way plants capture light for performing photosynthesis. However, much attention must be paid toward the consistency between virtual plants and plants in the field in terms of size and geometry to accurately evaluate light interception. This paper thus aimed at i) assessing the capacity of a 3D architectural model based on oil palms (Elaeis guineensis) to accurately represent plants structural characteristics at both the scale of the individual plant and the cultivated plot and ii) employing the validated 3D mock-ups to investigate how light interception efficiency varies among progenies that exhibit different architectures. Innovative indicators related to plant geometry and topology were derived from terrestrial LiDAR scanners (TLS) and hemispherical photographs (HP) in order to assess a 3D plant model. Indicators such as plant height, width and volume, gap fractions and solid angle projections were established from field measurements and were compared to equivalent indicators that had been extracted from virtual TLS (VTLS) and virtual HP (VHP) simulated on 3D mock-ups. Indicators were then evaluated for their significance in terms of light interception. Progeny effect on light interception efficiency was finally evaluated for five progenies. The structural indicators estimated from VTLS and VHP were significantly correlated with equivalent indicators estimated from TLS and HP, respectively, and with simulated outputs related to light interception. Light interception efficiencies estimated from validated 3D mock-ups differed significantly among the five progenies under study, most notably along plant development. Our results highlight the relevance of combining TLS- and HP-derived indicators to evaluate the reliability of virtual 3D reconstruction of plants in relation to light capture, at both the plant and plot scales. The study paves the way for further investigations aiming at unravelling the relationships between oil palm architecture and the physiological processes driving its production.},

This is possibly one reason why the integration of genetic variability into 3D architectural models has so far been largely overlooked. In this study, an allometry-based approach was developed to account for architectural variability in 3D architectural models of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) as a case study. Allometric relationships were used to model architectural traits from individual leaflets to the entire crown while accounting for ontogenetic and morphogenetic gradients. Inter- and intra-progeny variabilities were evaluated for each trait and mixed-effect models were used to estimate the mean and variance parameters required for complete 3D virtual plants. Significant differences in leaf geometry (petiole length, density of leaflets, and rachis curvature) and leaflet morphology (gradients of leaflet length and width) were detected between and within progenies and were modelled in order to generate populations of plants that were consistent with the observed populations. The application of mixed-effect models on allometric relationships highlighted an interesting trade-off between model accuracy and ease of defining parameters for the 3D reconstruction of plants while at the same time integrating their observed variability. Future research will be dedicated to sensitivity analyses coupling the structural model presented here with a radiative balance model in order to identify the key architectural traits involved in light interception efficiency.},

We also modelled this light with a purposely created 3D, spatially explicit, ray-tracing light interception model, where canopy porosity was calibrated to match measured daily light. Finally, we used both the measured and modeled light patterns transmitted under the tree canopies to estimate the daily net photosynthesis (An) and radiation use efficiency (RUE) of an understory wheat leaf. As expected, modeled light was more uniform than measured light, even at equal daily light. This resulted in large overestimation of daily An and RUE of the understory leaf. Averaging light in time increased the overestimations even further. A sensitivity analysis showed that this overestimation remained substantial over the range of realistic values for leaf photosynthetic parameters (i.e. Vc,max, Jmax, Rd) of the understory crop.},

The two main components of these pro-cesses, convective heat transfer and transpiration, are inevitably coupled as both processes are restricted by the leaf boundary layer. To measure leaf heat capacity and leaf heat transfer co-efficient, we thoroughly tested and applied an active thermography method that uses a transi-ent heat pulse to compute τ, the time constant of leaf cooling after release of the pulse. We validated our approach in the laboratory on intact leaves of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), and measured τ-changes at different boundary layer conditions. By modelling the leaf heat transfer coefficient with dimensionless numbers, we could demon-strate that τ improves our ability to close the energy budget of plant leaves and that modelling of transpiration requires considerations of convection. Applying our approach to thermal im-ages we obtained spatio-temporal maps of τ, providing observations of local differences in thermal responsiveness of leaf surfaces. We propose that active thermography is an informative methodology to measure leaf heat transfer and derive spatial maps of thermal responsiveness of leaves contributing to improve models of leaf heat transfer processes.},

These may result in significant bias in estimating photosynthetic parameters. To avoid the above-mentioned hypotheses, we present a new method for fitting A−Ci curves and CF data simultaneously. This method was applied to a data set obtained from cucumber (Cucumis sativus) leaves of various leaf ages and grown under eight different light conditions. The new method had significantly lower root mean square error and a lower rate of failures compared with previously published methods (6.72\% versus 24.1\%, respectively) and the effect of light conditions on Vcmax and J was better observed. Furthermore, the new method allows the estimation of a new parameter, the fraction of incoming irradiance harvested by photosystem II, and the dependence of gm on Ci.},

	abstract = {Photorespiratory metabolism is essential for plants to maintain functional photosynthesis in an oxygen-containing environment. Because the oxygenation reaction of Rubisco is followed by the loss of previously fixed carbon, photorespiration is often considered a wasteful process and considerable efforts are aimed at minimizing the negative impact of photorespiration on the plant’s carbon uptake. However, the photorespiratory pathway has also many positive aspects, as it is well integrated within other metabolic processes, such as nitrogen assimilation and C1 metabolism, and it is important for maintaining the redox balance of the plant. The overall effect of photorespiratory carbon loss on the net CO2 fixation of the plant is also strongly influenced by the physiology of the leaf related to CO2 diffusion. This review outlines the distinction between Rubisco oxygenation and photorespiratory CO2 release as a basis to evaluate the costs and benefits of photorespiration.},

The use of conventional fitting methods may lead not only to incorrect parameters but also several previously unrecognized consequences. For example, the relationships between key parameters may be fixed computationally and certain fits may be produced in which the estimated parameters result in contradictory identification of the limitation states of the data. Here we describe a new approach that is better suited to the FvCB model characteristics. It consists of four main steps: (1) enumeration of all possible distributions of limitation states; (2) fitting the FvCB model to each limitation state distribution by minimizing a distribution-wise cost function that has desirable properties for parameter estimation; (3) identification and correction of inadmissible fits; and (4) selection of the best fit from all possible limitation state distributions. The new approach implemented theoretical parameter resolvability with numerical procedures that maximally use the information content of the data. It was tested with model simulations, sampled A/Ci curves, and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of different tree species. The new approach is accessible through the automated website leafweb.ornl.gov.},

In this study, we showed that measuring detached rice leaves in the laboratory can not effectively represent the parameters measured in situ. We further described a new indoor facility, high-efficiency all-weather photosynthetic measurement system (HAPS), and the associated measurement protocol to enable whole-weather measurement of photosynthetic parameters of rice grown in the paddy fields. Using HAPS, we can conduct photosynthetic measurements with a time span much longer than that appropriate for the outdoor measurements. Comparative study shows that photosynthetic parameters obtained with the new protocol can effectively represent the parameters in the fields. There was much less standard deviation for measurements using HAPS compared to the outdoor measurements, no matter for technical replications of each recording or for biological replications of each leaf position. This new facility and protocol enables rice photosynthetic physiology studies to be less tough but more efficient, and provides a potential option for large scale studies of rice leaf photosynthesis.},

Here, rice (Oriza sativa L.) indica cultivar IR64 were grown in controlled environment chambers under current ambient CO2 concentration until heading, and thereafter two CO2 treatments (400 and 800 μmol mol−1) were compared in the presence and absence of a panicle-pruning treatment modifying the C sink. At 2 weeks after heading, photosynthetic parameters derived from CO2 response curves, and non-structural carbohydrate content of flag leaf and internodes were measured three to four times of day. Spikelet number per panicle and flag leaf area on the main culm were recorded. Net C assimilation and TPU decreased progressively after midday in panicle-pruned plants, especially under 800 μmol mol−1 CO2. This TPU reduction was explained by sucrose accumulation in the flag leaf resulting from the sink limitation. Taking together, our findings suggest that TPU is involved in the regulation of photosynthesis in rice under elevated CO2 conditions, and that sink limitation effects should be considered in crop models.},

A proxy trait called local C source–sink ratio was defined as the ratio of flag leaf area to the number of spikelets on the corresponding panicle, and five genotypes differing in this ratio were grown in a controlled greenhouse. Differential CO2 resources were applied either during the 2 weeks following heading (EXP1) or during the whole growth cycle (EXP2). Under e-CO2, low source–sink ratio cultivars (LSS) had greater gains in photosynthesis, and they accumulated less nonstructural carbohydrate in the flag leaf than high source–sink ratio cultivars (HSS). In EXP2, grain yield and biomass gain was also greater in LSS probably caused by their strong sink. Photosynthetic capacity response to e-CO2 was negatively correlated across genotypes with local C source–sink ratio, a trait highly conserved across environments. HSS were sink-limited under e-CO2, probably associated with low triose phosphate utilization (TPU) capacity. We suggest that the local C source–sink ratio is a potential target for selecting more CO2-responsive cultivars, pending validation for a broader genotypic spectrum and for field conditions.},

	abstract = {The ability to assimilate C and allocate NSC (non structural carbohydrates) to the most appropriate organs is crucial to maximize plant ecological or agronomic performance. Such C source and sink activities are differentially affected by environmental constraints. Under drought, plant growth is generally more sink than source limited as organ expansion or appearance rate is earlier and stronger affected than C assimilation. This favors plant survival and recovery but not always agronomic performance as NSC are stored rather than used for growth due to a modified metabolism in source and sink leaves. Such interactions between plant C and water balance are complex and plant modeling can help analyzing their impact on plant phenotype. This paper addresses the impact of trade-offs between C sink and source activities and plant production under drought, combining experimental and modeling approaches. Two contrasted monocotyledonous species (rice, oil palm) were studied. Experimentally, the sink limitation of plant growth under moderate drought was confirmed as well as the modifications in NSC metabolism in source and sink organs. Under severe stress, when C source became limiting, plant NSC concentration decreased. Two plant models dedicated to oil palm and rice morphogenesis were used to perform a sensitivity analysis and further explore how to optimize C sink and source drought sensitivity to maximize plant growth. Modeling results highlighted that optimal drought sensitivity depends both on drought type and species and that modeling is a great opportunity to analyse such complex processes. Further modeling needs and more generally the challenge of using models to support complex trait breeding are discussed.},

	abstract = {We present a new approach to simulate the distribution of natural light within plant canopies. The canopy is described in 3D, each organ being represented by a set of polygons. Our model calculates the light incident on each polygon. The principle is to distinguish for each polygon the contribution of the light coming directly from light sources, the light scattered from close polygons and that scattered from far polygons. Close polygons are defined as located inside a sphere surrounding the studied polygon and having a diameter Ds. The direct light is computed by projection. The exchanges between close polygons are computed by the radiosity method, whereas the contribution from far polygons is estimated by a multi-layer model. The main part of computing time corresponds to the calculations of the geometric coefficients of the radiosity system. Then radiative exchanges can be quickly simulated for various conditions of the angular distribution of incoming light and various optical properties of soil and phytolelements. Simulations compare satisfactorily with those produced by a Monte Carlo ray tracing. They show that considering explicitly the close neighboring of each polygon improves the estimation of organs irradiance, by taking into account the local variability of fluxes. For a virtual maize canopy, these estimations are satisfying with Ds=0.5 m; in these conditions, the simulation time on a workstation was 25 min for a canopy of 100 plants.},

	abstract = {Radiation is a direct or indirect driver of essentially all biophysical processes in plant systems, and is commonly described through the use of models because of its complex distributions in time and space. Detailed radiation transfer models that represent plant-scale heterogeneity have high computational resource requirements, thus severely limiting the size of problems that can be feasibly considered, while simplified models that can represent entire canopies usually neglect heterogeneity across a wide range of scales. This work develops new methods for computing radiation absorption, transmission, scattering, and emission using ray-tracing approaches that can explicitly represent scales ranging from leaves to canopies. This work focuses on developing a new “reverse” ray-tracing method for describing radiation emission and scattering that ensures all geometric elements (e.g., leaves, branches) are adequately sampled, which guarantees that modelled radiative fluxes are bounded within a reasonable range of values regardless of the number of rays used. This is a critical property when complex model geometries are used, which can be subject to severe sampling errors even when very large ray counts are used. The presented model uses graphics processing units (GPUs) along with highly optimized software to efficiently perform ray-object intersection tests in parallel. This allowed for the simulation of {\textgreater}500 fully resolved trees on a desktop computer in under five minutes.},

LUE and WUE were derived using cumulated (data aggregates across samplings) and independent (data increments across samplings) approaches. Use of cumulated data yielded strong-but-false correlation between AGB and APAR or ETc, being a statistical artefact. RUE values from an independent approach were substantially lower than that from a cumulated approach with greater standard errors. Overall, a cumulated approach tends to oversimplify the complex interactions among carbon and resource coupling in agroecosystems, which is accurately represented when employing an independent approach instead.},

	abstract = {Increases in the frequency and severity of droughts across many regions worldwide necessitate an improved capacity to determine the water status of plants at organ, whole plant, canopy, and regional scales. Noninvasive methods have most potential for simultaneously improving basic water relations research and ground-, flight-, and space-based sensing of water status, with applications in sustainability, food security, and conservation. The most frequently used methods to measure the most salient proxies of plant water status, that is, water mass per leaf area (WMA), relative water content (RWC), and leaf water potential (Ψleaf), require the excision of tissues and laboratory analysis, and have thus been limited to relatively low throughput and small study scales. Applications using electromagnetic radiation in the visible, infrared, and terahertz ranges can resolve the water status of canopies, yet heretofore have typically focused on statistical approaches to estimating RWC for leaves before and after severe dehydration, and few have predicted Ψleaf. Terahertz radiation has great promise to estimate leaf water status across the range of leaf dehydration important for the control of gas exchange and leaf survival. We demonstrate a refined method and physical model to predict WMA, RWC, and Ψleaf from terahertz transmission across a wide range of levels of dehydration for given leaves of three species, as well as across leaves of given species and across multiple species. These findings highlight the powerful potential and the outstanding challenges in applying in vivo terahertz spectrometry as a remote sensor of water status for a range of applications.},

	abstract = {Variations in drought responses exhibited by cohabiting tree species such as Acer sacharrum and Quercus alba have often been attributed to differences in rooting depth or water accessibility. A. sacharrum is thought to be a shallow rooted species, and is assumed to not have access to the deep and stable water resources available to Q. alba. As such, A. sacharrum conserves water by minimizing stomatal conductance under drought conditions whereas Q. alba does not. However, detailed records of sufficient temporal resolution which integrate water accessibility, meteorological drivers, and leaf level parameters (e.g., photosynthesis, stomatal conductance) are lacking, making such assumptions—though plausible— largely untested. In this study, we investigated the water accessibility of both maples (A. sacharrum) and oaks (Q. alba) during the late growing season using novel canopy stable isotope measurements. Our results showed that maples can draw from the same water pool as cohabitating oaks, but can also switch to a shallow water source in response to available moisture in the shallow soil profile. We also found that maples tended to use a deep water source under high vapor pressure deficit even when shallow soil water was available. On the other hand, oaks had consistent deep water access during our study period. It is noted that our measurements do not cover the whole growing season and should be extrapolated with caution. Such findings indicate that differences in leaf functions during drought between maples and oaks may be due to both soil water accessibility and atmospheric water demand.},

	abstract = {Many agronomic systems could be at risk considering the short-term climate changes, but several effects and interactions  are  still uncertain. Therefore,  there  is  an  increasing  need  for  information  to  better  predict  future climate  change  impacts  on  perennial  crops  and  forests  and  to  design  new  agricultural  and  silvicultural practices to cope with these changes (Brisson et al., 2010). All those changes lead to complex combinations of effects  on  the  water  and  carbon  balances  of  ecosystems,  and  can  thus,  potentially,  affect  agro-ecosystem production (Way et al., 2015). Process-based  models  (PBMs)  are  generally  well  suited  to  address  these  challenges.  PBMs  apply  our understanding of fundamental physical and ecophysiological processes to simulate the system mechanistically (Bohn  et  al.,  2014).  They  can  be  used  to  estimate  fluxes  and  stocks  of  energy,  water,  and  carbon  in  the ecosystem, as a function of climate, soil, and plant characteristics. Coffee growth and fruit production are particularly sensitive to high temperatures and water availability, and previous studies often predicts future huge losses of productionor area cover. Nevertheless, shade provided in agroforestry  systems  could  mitigate  the  effects  of  climate  changes  under  different  management  options. Hence,  during  this  thesis,  we  first  updated  a  3D  PBM  (MAESPA)  to  account  for  temperature  and  vapor pressure  within  the  canopy,  and testedit  on  two  ecosystems,  a  Eucalyptus  plantation  in  Brazil,  and Coffea arabicaplantation in Costa Rica. Then, we used MAESPA to make metamodels that were integrated on a new dynamic  cropmodel  that  we  developed  to  assess  the Coffearesponse  to  climate  change,  and  the  possible solutions offered by different agroforestry management to mitigate these effects. Consequently, we modelled several  management  options  of  coffee  agroforestry  systems,  e.g.  shade  tree  density  and  species  to  estimate their suitability and provision of ecosystem services under predicted future climate changes. A rating between management scenarios was thenproposed by comparing canopy temperature, coffee and timber yield, carbon balance and water use of past and future coffee growth cycles, under two contrasted future climatic scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5).The dynamic  crop model predicts an  increased coffee primary productivity thanks  to the increased atmospheric CO2concentration, but a decreased coffee yield because less flowers were initiated per coffee plants by 2100. The model predicts a positive shade effect on coffee yield, especially under high mean annual temperatures, up to +20.9\% yield compared to full sun plantation under RCP8.5. However, the positive effect of shade couldn't help sustaining current yields, whatever the shade tree species or management.},

	abstract = {Improving our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fine roots in deep soil layers is of utter importance to manage tropical planted forests in a context of climate change. Our study aimed to assess the effect of clear-cutting and drought on fine-root dynamics down to the water table in Brazilian ferralsol under eucalypt plantations conducted in coppice. Fine roots (i.e. diameter {\textless}2 mm) were sampled down to 17 m deep in a throughfall exclusion experiment comparing stands with 37\% of throughfall excluded by plastic sheets (−W) and stands without rain exclusion (+W). Root dynamics were studied using minirhizotron in two permanent pits down to 17 m deep, over 1 year before clear-cutting, then over 2 years in coppice, as well as down to 4 m deep in a non-harvested plot (NH) serving as a control. After harvesting, a spectacular fine root growth of trees conducted in coppice occurred in very deep soil layers ({\textgreater}13 m) and, surprisingly, root mortality remained extremely low whatever the depth and the treatment. Total fine-root biomass in coppice down to 17 m depth was 1266 and 1017 g m−2 in +W and −W, respectively, at 1.5 year after the clear-cut and was 1078 g m−2 in NH 7.5 years after planting. Specific root length and specific root area were about 15\% higher in −W than in +W. Proliferation of fine roots at great depths could be an adaptive mechanism for tree survival, enhancing the access to water stored in the subsoil. The root system established before clear-cutting provides access to water stored in very deep layers that probably contribute to mitigate the risk of tree mortality during prolonged drought periods when the eucalypt plantations is conducted in coppice after the clear-cut.},

Currently insufficient information on the biology and epidemiology of the pathogen limits the development of efficient management options to control MPR. This research aims to elucidate MPR development through the following daily microclimatic variables: minimum and maximum temperatures, wetness frequency, average temperature and relative humidity in the highly susceptible cacao clone Pound-7 (incidence = 86\% 2008–2013 average). A total of 55 cohorts totaling 2,268 pods of 3–10 cm length, one to two months of age, were tagged weekly. Pods were assessed throughout their lifetime, every one or two weeks, and classified in 3 different categories: healthy, diseased with no sporulation, diseased with sporulating lesions. As a first step, we used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to determine with no a priori the period (when and for how long) each climatic variable was better related with the appearance of symptoms and sporulation. Then the significance of the candidate variables was tested in a complete GLMM. Daily average wetness frequency from day 14 to day 1, before tagging, and daily average maximum temperature from day 4 to day 21, after tagging, were the most explanatory variables of the symptoms appearance. The former was positively linked with the symptoms appearance when the latter exhibited a maximum at 30°C. The most important variables influencing sporulation were daily average minimum temperature from day 35 to day 58 and daily average maximum temperature from day 37 to day 48, both after tagging. Minimum temperature was negatively linked with the sporulation while maximum temperature was positively linked. Results indicated that the fungal microclimatic requirements vary from the early to the late cycle stages, possibly due to the pathogen’s long latent period. This information is valuable for development of new conceptual models for MPR and improvement of control methods.},

In this work, we characterized, in a 5-year-old Eucalyptus grandis plantation in Brazil, changes in fungal community within soil profiles and whether these changes are influenced or not by a water stress using a through-fall reduction experiment. This research was conducted at the experimental station of Itatinga (ESALQ-USP). Root samples were collected between May and June 2015. Fine roots ({\textless} 2 mm) were sampled carefully layer per layer during the digging of a pit (1.5 x 4 meters) in order to prevent any contaminations between two consecutive soil depths. Ten soil layers have been sampled from 0 to 4 meter depth. An Illumina sequencing of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS2) was carried out on DNA extracted from root samples to study fungal community composition and diversity. We showed that the fungal communities were dominated by ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM).The fungus Pisolithus represented more than 80\% of the fungal community. For the first time, both ECM sequences and ECM root tips were observed along the profiles down to 4 meters. By subsampling the root tips of Pisolithus, we showed that Pisolithus populations responded strongly both to the depth and to the rainfall reduction. This work represents a step forward in the microbial ecology with the evidence, for the first time, of the occurrence of ECMs down to a depth of 4 meters. These results highlight the importance to expand these researches to other tropical perennial plants of major interest in order to evaluate the genericity of our observations made on eucalyptus.},

In this work, we characterized, in a 5-year-old Eucalyptus grandis plantation in Brazil, changes in fungal community within soil profiles and whether these changes are influenced or not by a water stress using a through-fall reduction experiment. This research was conducted at the experimental station of Itatinga (ESALQ-USP). Root samples were collected between May and June 2015. Fine roots ({\textless} 2 mm) were sampled carefully layer per layer during the digging of a pit (1.5 x 4 meters) in order to prevent any contaminations between two consecutive soil depths. Ten soil layers have been sampled from 0 to 4 meter depth. An Illumina sequencing of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS2) was carried out on DNA extracted from root samples to study fungal community composition and diversity. We showed that the fungal communities were dominated by ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM).The fungus Pisolithus represented more than 80\% of the fungal community. For the first time, both ECM sequences and ECM root tips were observed along the profiles down to 4 meters. By subsampling the root tips of Pisolithus, we showed that Pisolithus populations responded strongly both to the depth and to the rainfall reduction. This work represents a step forward in the microbial ecology with the evidence, for the first time, of the occurrence of ECMs down to a depth of 4 meters. These results highlight the importance to expand these researches to other tropical perennial plants of major interest in order to evaluate the genericity of our observations made on eucalyptus.},
