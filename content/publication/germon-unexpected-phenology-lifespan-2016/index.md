abstract: "Fine roots play a major role in the global carbon cycle through respiration, exudation and decomposition processes, but their dynamics are poorly understood. Current estimates of root dynamics have principally been observed in shallow soil horizons (textless1 m), and mainly in forest systems. We studied walnut (Juglans regia × nigra L.) fine root dynamics in an agroforestry system in a Mediterranean climate, with a focus on deep soils (down to 5 m), and root dynamics throughout the year."
